For\nexample, makefile for <code>c-example\\src\\calc.c</code> would be <code>c-example\\build\\utbot\\make\\calc.mk</code>. Please note: makefiles\nand tests are generated at the same time.</li>\n<li>When necessary makefile is found, use the 'cd' command to move from your present directory to makefile's one.</li>\n<li>Run <code>make -s -f calc.mk run</code>, for example.</li>\n<li>Congratulations!
