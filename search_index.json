in VS Code with UTBot plugin enabled, the plugin tries to obtain information about the\nproject structure. UTBot needs this information to create sources’ ASTs with clang-tooling and to rebuild the project in\nLLVM IR. LLVM has a special format, designed to store project information (i.e. compilation database) —\n[compile_commands.json](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/LibTooling.html). There are various ways to obtain\ncompile_commands.json:\n\n* If a project is built with CMake, one can pass CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON option to it;\n* One can run the [Bear tool](https://github.com/rizsotto/Bear). Bear is able to create compile_commands.json by\n  analysing Makefile commands, hence, Bear can be used if make command can be applied to a project.\n\nUnfortunately, compile_commands.json only contains information about compilation of individual source files. That is not\nsufficient to determine function behaviour. Consider a function 𝑓, which calls a function 𝑔 in its body, while 𝑔 is\nspecified by an external symbol. The definition of 𝑔 can be provided to 𝑓 if an artifact containing 𝑓 is linked with\nthe artifact containing 𝑔. If there are multiple functions 𝑔 in the project, it is impossible to determine, which\nfunction is used by 𝑓, with only compile commands. To find a solution, a new format was invented — link_commands.json.\nIt shares the way of representing data with compile_commands.json, but holds information from project link commands. A\nlink_commands.json example can be viewed bellow. With this information, it is easy to solve the mentioned problem — one\nhas to look up for a pair of artifacts containing 𝑓 and 𝑔, which are linked together while the project builds. UTBot\nneeded to be able to retrieve both compile and link information from a project. The vast majority of C/C++ projects are\nbuilt with either CMake or Makefile build systems. UTBot supports both of these, using the following approach:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"command\": \"/usr/bin/ar qc liblib.a CMakeFiles/lib.dir/file3.c.o\",\n    \"directory\": \"c-example/build\",\n    \"files\": [\n      \"c-example/build/CMakeFiles/lib.dir/file3.c.o\"\n    ]\n  },\n  {\n    \"command\": \"clang -fuse-ld=gold CMakeFiles/exe2.dir/file4.c.o -o exe2  liblib.a\",\n    \"directory\": \"c-example/build\",\n    \"files\": [\n      \"c-example/build/CMakeFiles/exe2.dir/file4.c.o\",\n      \"c-example/build/liblib.a\"\n    ]\n  },\n  {\n    \"command\": \"/usr/bin/ar qc libhelper.a CMakeFiles/helper.dir/file1.c.o\",\n    \"directory\": \"c-example/build\",\n    \"files\": [\n      \"c-example/build/CMakeFiles/helper.dir/file1.c.o\"\n    ]\n  },\n  {\n    \"command\": \"clang -fuse-ld=gold CMakeFiles/exe1.dir/file2.c.o -o exe1 libhelper.a liblib.a\",\n    \"directory\": \"c-example/build\",\n    \"files\": [\n      \"c-example/build/CMakeFiles/exe1.dir/file2.c.o\",\n      \"c-example/build/libhelper.a\",\n      \"c-example/build/liblib.a\"\n    ]\n  }\n]\n```\n\n1. If a given project is a CMake project, UTBot prompts user to invoke a cmake command on it, generating Makefiles (or\n   offers to automatically do it by itself). From now on, all projects can be treated as projects which are built with\n   the use of Makefiles;\n2. UTBot applies Bear to project Makefiles. Bear is able to create compile_commands.json, and it was patched, so it is\n   able to construct link_commands.json as well.\n\nThe approach scheme can be viewed on scheme bellow, with algorithm steps highlighted with blue arrows.\n\n![jsons](https://github.com/UnitTestBot/unittestbot.github.io/raw/source/resources/images/jsons.png)\n\n","path":"/docs/cpp/advanced/compile-database"},"dad57822-784d-57e8-8cce-41c5a2baafd4":{"name":"Coverage","content":"\n# Coverage\n\nWhen user wants to get information about coverage achieved by UTBot tests, UTBot recompiles test files and user code\nwith coverage instrumentation, using gcov or llvm-cov, depending on the chosen compiler for running tests.

For each test file, a\ncorresponding header file is generated; its contents are explained\nbelow.\n\nUTBot performs a complex transformation of KLEE output into\ntests sources. KLEE returns raw byte values for symbolic objects,\nand UTBot is able to construct human-like code that assigns these\nbytes to variables. For instance, UTBot sets structures fields one by\none with assignment operators instead of performing one memcpy().\n\nUTBot provides its users an option to compile test files, link them\nwith user code and run them to get test results and coverage rates.\nUTBot Makefile that contains compilation and run commands is\ngenerated along with tests based on link_commands.json. There\nare many complications arising when UTBot links user code to\ngenerated tests:\n\n * If user code contains a C static function, which was analysed\nby UTBot, generated tests binary can not be linked, because\nstatic functions are available only in the source file they are\ndeclared. To handle this problem, UTBot generates wrapper\nfiles with non-static function that include original files via\n`#include directory`. Functions in wrapper files have same\nsignatures as original static functions and wrapper functions\ndelegate to original static functions in their bodies. For tests\nto be compiled and run, UTBot substitute wrapper files instead of original files in UTBot Makefile via environment\nvariables. Functions in wrapper files and user files have different names, so a name mangling technique is applied to\nallow using user-defined names for them in test files.\n * In case of using stubs, tests are generated and run with original files in UTBot Makefile replaced by stubs via environment\nvariable.\n * C++ has some keywords, which are absent in C, for example,\ntry or reinterpret_cast. Those keywords can be used as\nfunction/variable names in C, so, in test headers, UTBot\nguards declared user function wrappers with a #define and\nan #undef macro, renaming them in a way they do not clash\nwith any C++ specific keyword.\n\n![Creating test executable on c-example project](https://github.com/UnitTestBot/unittestbot.github.io/raw/source/resources/images/runExample.png)\n\nFigure 7 represents the way of creating test executable for a generated test file. UTBot reuses the structure it creates when linking\nproject files, takes the same compile and link commands, but this\ntime user files are compiled not to LLVM bitcode, but to native binaries. UTBot takes the same project target it used to pass to KLEE\nand links it with generated test file. This way, functions called from\nthe test file have all symbols they need. One important step is that,\nduring this stage, UTBot links user executables as shared libraries\nfor them to be linkable with generated test files. Despite UTBot\nuses only Clang to compile user project into LLVM IR and to obtain\ncompile_commands.json, it is possible run tests with a broader\nset of compilers, with UTBot supporting gcc, g++, clang and\nclang++.","path":"/docs/cpp/advanced/generating-and-running-tests"},"8af73aee-9fc2-5ca2-898c-032295603f63":{"name":"Incrementality","content":"\n# Incrementality\n\nUsers can create multiple requests of tests generation; UTBot creates many artifacts for each of them, namely:\n\n* UTBot KLEE files;\n* UTBot stub files and headers;\n* Object files and project targets for user project files, KLEE files, stub files built both in LLVM bitcode and with a\n  classic C/C++compiler/linker;\n* Test source files and headers;\n* Test executables.\n* UTBot Makefiles\n\nNotice that many of those artifacts are reusable between test generation requests: if a test generation happens for two\nfiles in the same project target, then all stub sources and artifacts from them, all but one project targets artifacts\nbuilt in LLVM bitcode and as native files, are already prepared by UTBot and do not need to be recreated.

KLEE was chosen as UTBot backend because it is able to operate on almost any C/C++\ncode (translated to LLVM IR). KLEE holds its place of one of the top tools for software verification and test generation\nin [recent years](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10009-020-00570-3), remains in active development and improvement stage, has\na wide community and is highly customizable for one’s needs. While the main goal of UTBot is to make tests generation\ntechniques accessible for regular developer, additional goal to improve default KLEE coverage is also persuaded. For\nthis goal, KLEE was patched and updated in various ways.\n\nExpanding the supported set of LLVM IR. KLEE 2.2 support a wide set of LLVM IR, which C/C++sources compile to. However,\nthere were unsupported instructions, which were determined to be vital for UTBot, so an effort was made to support them\nin KLEE.\n\n## Floating point\n\nNamely, floating-point and sanitizer instructions were supported for symbolic execution. For floating-point\ninstructions,\n[KLEE-Float](https://doi.org/10.1109/ASE.2017.8115670), a development, which addresses the same problem, was rebased on\nKLEE 2.2; also, a floating-point runtime library was added. For sanitizer instructions, corresponding handlers were\nadded. Those two patches are important for UTBot: symbolic execution of floating-point instructions increases code\ncoverage, while sanitizer instructions were needed as UTBot rebuilds a given project with sanitizer support to increase\nthe quality of software verification. Sanitizer introduces new branches for many corner cases (like buffer overflows)\nand tests are generated to cover these interesting cases.\n\n## Lazy initialization\n\nKLEE symbolically executes functions one at a time, and if the code is symbolically executed in an empty symbolic state,\nsome paths may be left unexplored because there are no objects in the heap. To overcome this obstacle, the lazy\ninitialization technique has been implemented. The memory operations\n(reading, writing, copying and freeing memory) in KLEE are implemented in the following way: to execute the memory\noperation on pointer 𝑝, the engine checks for every heap location if the pointer can reference this location. For every\nsatisfiable variant, it forks the symbolic state adding into the path condition the equality of 𝑝 and the heap address\nunder consideration. This behaviour has been extended. Now, the engine checks if current heap locations do not cover\nevery possible variant 𝑝 can reference. If not, then the engine instantiates the new block of symbolic memory and forks\nthe state adding into the path condition the equality of 𝑝 and the concrete heap address of this fresh block.\n\n## KLEE parameters\n\nA parameter bcov_check_interval was added to KLEE; it is designed to put timeout on symbolic execution. When KLEE\nanalyses a branch for a while and does not increase code coverage for specified amount of time, the symbolic execution\nfor such a branch is stopped.\n\n## POSIX Runtime\n\nUTBot is able to generate tests for functions, that use I/O processing via stdin and stdout — a way of substituting them\nwith custom data in test bodies was invented. KLEE has its POSIX runtime, which allows symbolic execution of code that\nuses I/O calls (like open() or fread()). Essentially, the runtime initializes a symbolic array for each file descriptor\nand redirects I/O calls to wrapper functions working with such variables. These wrapper functions can be treated as\nstubs for POSIX functions calls, but provided not by UTBot, but by KLEE itself. UTBot only adds variables to KLEE POSIX\nruntime, which stand for the number of bytes used in symbolic stdin, stdout and files. Consequently, UTBot will have the\ninformation on exact number of bytes used by user code in every execution path and will not pollute test bodies with\nexcessive data created by KLEE.\n\n## Interactive mode\n\nIn the previous utbot's version `Generate Tests For Project` and `Generate Tests For Current File` launch `klee` for\nevery function in a project or a file respectively. `Klee` spends significant part of time to preprocess an input file,\nwhich small changes, when we generate tests for all functions in one file. Only entrypoint changes between different\nlaunches of `klee`.\n\n`Interactive mode` solves this problem: now we generate tests for all functions in a file for one launch of `klee`. And\nwe make several parallel processes with `fork()` after `klee` finishes preprocessing to work with test generation for\ndifferent functions.\n\nSee the difference in time:\n\n| interactive_mode \\ number of functions in file  | 10    | 50    | 100    | 500    |\n|-------------------------------------------------|-------|-------|--------|--------|\n| without interactive                             | 14.2s | 71.6s | 143.9s | 963s   |\n| with interactive and 1 parallel process         | 3.8s  | 14.9s | 30.3s  | 189s   |\n| with interactive and 5 parallel process         | 2.2s  | 6.6s  | 12.4s  | 66.8s  |\n| with interactive and 10 parallel process        | 1.9s  | 5.7s  | 10.4s  | 52.3s  |\n\n## Inline assembly\n\nCalling inline assembly as _external_ functions has been added. Now `klee` can execute branches with inline assembly\nand `UTBot` generate tests for it. Due to the fact that there is an _external_ call, we may not cover all branches,\nbut `UTBot` will generate at least some tests. `klee` can call the assembler of the platform on which it itself runs. In particular,\nvector instructions work on `x86`. `klee` can execute all assembly that represent as `call <type> asm ...` in `LLVM IR`,\nso `UTBot` still can't do anything with assembler files.","path":"/docs/cpp/advanced/klee-patches"},"5c7fc7c2-b79d-5581-a53b-aec2c8e8590e":{"name":"Linking bitcode","content":"\n# Linking bitcode\n\nLet us name a C/C++ type, struct or a function definition as a code symbol. If any C/C++ code uses a symbol, for the\ncode to be compiled, linked and run, the code artifact must contain that symbol.\n\nIn the example, max function does not use any other symbols in the code. Thus, to symbolically execute max function and\ngenerate tests, it is sufficient for UTBot to compile the corresponding KLEE file into LLVM IR and pass the bitcode to\nsymbolic execution engine.\n\nHowever, in real projects, functions call other functions, and the common case in C/C++ is that symbols may be defined\nin another object file, which has to be linked with the original function object file. Hence, LLVM bitcode of KLEE files\nneeds to be linked with other bitcode files, which contain needed symbols.\n\nAs it was mentioned, UTBot can get information about user project build structure by running Bear tool.\n\n![c-example project](https://github.com/UnitTestBot/unittestbot.github.io/raw/source/resources/images/targetExample.png)\n\nFigure above presents the c-example project which will be referenced to illustrate UTBot linking behaviour. Suppose that\nUTBot is requested to perform test generation for a function inside file3.c. Prior to linking phase, UTBot receives\ninformation about what object file file3.c compiles into (in the figure, this file is called file3.o), as well as the\ninformation about project linkage structure. Note that link_commands.json presented\nin [Compile database](compile-database) is exactly the json UTBot generates for c-example project. During test\ngeneration process, it is stored in a graph like the one in the figure. A C/C++ project consists of object files, static\nand dynamic libraries, and executables. Let us call a static library, a dynamic library, or an executable a project\ntarget.\n\nIf functions from file3.o use symbols from other object files in the project, it is needed to link file3.o with them to\nprovide complete function definitions for KLEE. UTBot tries to minimally change user code and test it as-is, so it is\ndesired to link code in the same way as it is linked in a user project. UTBot uses a reasonable assumption: If user\nproject defines project targets, which include an object file, they are likely to contain all the needed symbols for it.\nThis is not always true, but it is conceivable that at least one project target actually uses functions from an object\nfile, so it should have all the needed symbols. Under this assumption, UTBot linkage algorithm looks for a suitable\nproject target that includes the selected object file and then creates LLVM bitcode module of this target for symbolic\nexecution.\n\nLinking a project target. To link a project target, UTBot first links its dependencies recursively, and then puts them\ntogether into the project target, operating in accordance with the following rules:\n\n* If currently processed project unit is an object file, it is built into LLVM IR from corresponding sources using clang\n  compiler with -emit-llvm option; if tests generation was requested for this file, then not the original file is\n  compiled, but the KLEE file for it.\n* If currently processed project unit is a static library, it is linked from LLVM bitcode files using ar tool with\n  –plugin LLVMGold.so. This stage uses the [LLVM Gold plugin](https://llvm.org/docs/GoldPlugin.html), as it allows archived result to be reused in another\n  link action, whereas default ar behaviour forbids that.\n* If currently processed project unit is a shared library or an executable, it is linked from its dependencies using ld\n  and LLVM Gold plugin, as shared libraries also can be linked into one another.\n\nAfter linkage, UTBot will have a module with a KLEE entry function wrapper for the code and all symbols, which the\nproject function might call. Such a module can be passed to KLEE. Suppose that test generation is requested for\nfunctions inside file3.c. Then UTBot will traverse c-example project as presented in figure below.\n\n![linking scheme](https://github.com/UnitTestBot/unittestbot.github.io/raw/source/resources/images/linkExample.png)\n\nThere are more problems that make the linking process more complex. Link process of exe1 target from c-example is\naddressed to illustrate the algorithm.\n\nThere might be a case in which no symbol from static library (for instance, lib.a) is used in shared library (exe1),\nwhich appears to be a selected target. This is possible, if the dependency of exe1 from lib.a is somehow mentioned in\nthe project build system, but no code from lib.a is actually used in exe1. ld plugin detects this and does not include\nthe lib.bc bitcode in the final module. Thus, the module will not have a symbol for KLEE entry wrapper, which UTBot has\nlinked into lib.bc, and, consequently, no tests will be generated as KLEE will not have a function definition to\ninterpret.\n\nThis can be solved by adding –whole-archive option to link command, which forces all the symbols to be included, even if\nthey are unused. But, if this approach is used, another problem occurs. lib.a may contain a function, which has a\ncomplete definition only when linked with exe2. Consider a function 𝑓 from lib.a, which uses function 𝑔 from file4.o.\nIf lib.a is linked with exe1, 𝑓 is discarded by the linker, but if its inclusion is forced by –whole-archive, the\nlinkage will fail because there is no symbol for 𝑔 both in lib.a and exe1.\n\nGiven that, forcing symbols into final module is not a good idea in general, and it is better to try another target; but\nif no project target uses symbols from lib.a, then this way of linking may be applied. If user project successfully\nlinks, UTBot is able to rebuild it in LLVM IR and substitute any project function with a symbolic wrapper.\n\nChoosing the right project target. To sum up, for correct linking of a bitcode module UTBot needs to find a project\ntarget which uses symbols from a specific object file. There are two types of targets UTBot tries to iteratively select\nand link:\n\n* Direct parents of the object file in link project structure. Typically, they are static libraries, which contain\n  needed symbols, because ar tool, with which they are built, includes all symbols from object files;\n* Targets, which recursively include the request file and do not have any parents in linking structure — root project`\n  targets. UTBot considers them for linking on the grounds that if there are dependencies between source files,\n  unmentioned in build system, then chances are those dependencies will not produce a problem if we build \"the biggest\"\n  project targets, which are most likely to be used in reality.\n\nUTBot finds mentioned targets by an object file and tries to iteratively build them into LLVM IR. When a correctly built\ntarget is found, linking process stops and the final bitcode is passed to KLEE.\n\nAlthough UTBot tries to guess project target automatically and it works for most users, in some scenarios it is\nimpossible to guess what the user actually wants. For example, function can have multiple behaviour depending on what it\nis linked with. In this case, UTBot offers its users a possibility to manually specify the project target.","path":"/docs/cpp/advanced/linking-bitcode"},"b2130571-f2b8-5dab-866b-cb5f9fb8e69d":{"name":"Makefiles","content":"\n# Makefiles\n\n[GNU make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html) is a primary tool for incremental build of bitcode and\nbinary files as well.

Let us consider a simple function:\n\n```c++\nint max( int a , int b ) {\n    if ( a > b ) {\n        return a ;\n    } else {\n        return b ;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nTreating the function as a unit for generating tests, UTBot marks its arguments and result as symbolic variables,\nforcing KLEE to calculate input parameters as well as the expected value. This is done by generating the wrapper\nklee_entry__<function_name>\nfor every function under test in so called KLEE file.\n\n```c++\n#include \"basic_functions.c\"\n#include \"klee/klee.h\"\n#include <stdlib.h>\nint klee_entry__max (int argc, char **argv, char **envp ) {\n    int a;\n    klee_make_symbolic (&a, sizeof(a) , \"a\");\n    klee_prefer_cex (&a , a >= −10 & a <= 10 );\n    int b;\n    klee_make_symbolic (&b, sizeof(b) , \"b\");\n    klee_prefer_cex (&b , b >= −10 & b <= 10 );\n    int res;\n    klee_make_symbolic (&res, sizeof(res), \"res\");\n    int utbot_tmp = max_(a, b);\n    klee_assume (utbot_tmp == result);\n    return 0 ;\n}\n```\n\nLet us break the wrapper down and explain its contents in detail:\n\n* Initial source file is included as \"basic_functions.c\" file; As a result of doing this, the function and its wrapper\n  are provided with the same set of defined symbols, which means that UTBot can call the tested function from the\n  wrapper file and with the same behaviour;\n* \"klee/klee.h\" is included to provide the file with KLEE API.\n* A KLEE entry function wrapper is created for targeted function. Inside it, the following things happen:\n    - Function arguments are marked as symbolic. In simplest case, this is achieved by calling klee_make_symbolic on a\n      fresh variable address. If the argument type is pointer, UTBot performs a more sophisticated approach — creates a\n      symbolic buffer and then creates pointer on stack that references this buffer. If the argument is a string, UTBot\n      automatically adds \\0 symbol to the end of symbolic buffer for it to represent a C-style string.\n    - Soft constraints are imposed on symbolic variables, advising KLEE to provide more human-readable test cases. Those\n      constraints are applied with a klee_prefer_cex call. Soft constraints are desirable but not necessary so KLEE can\n      discard them if needed for a branch exploration. For symbolic arrays, soft constraint is applied for every item.\n    - A symbolic variable is created for a function result. That is done in the same way as creating symbolic variables\n      for function arguments.\n    - A concrete variable is created and its value is assigned to a function call result. When the file will be passed\n      into KLEE, it is this line in which the symbolic engine will branch and explore target function paths.\n    - A constraint is applied to new symbolic variable, setting it equal to calculated function result. This is done\n      with klee_assume call. Since KLEE writes out all symbolic variables, UTBot forces function result to be calculated\n      for every argument set KLEE has explored. Therefore, UTBot does not need to rerun user code for received argument\n      sets and already has the information about function return value.\n\nIn advanced generation scenario when UTBot generates test that run through specified line of code, UTBot modifies source\ncode of function under test (virtually, by clang tooling), adding global variable line_touched; and statement\nline_touched=1; next to the selected line of code. Change of this new global variable can be monitored by klee_assume\nsimilarly to assuming the function result value.","path":"/docs/cpp/advanced/preparing-sources-for-klee"},"7d705758-70fb-5b95-85ef-d0271d500f08":{"name":"Stubs inside","content":"\nThe paradigm of unit testing is to verify correctness of code units in isolation. There may be many opinions on what is\na unit: a function, a file, a class or even a library; UTBot defines a unit as the smallest project target that contains\nselected code. For example, if it code from file1.c is tested (see Figure 5), then helper.bc\n(rather then exe1.bc) will be selected as its unit. When tests for unit are generated, there may be an interest to test\nthem with respect that when functions from another unit are called, their complete testing is unwanted. It is a common\npractice to use stubs for such functions — functions with same signatures, that execute simplified behaviour, which\nallows testing process to focus on a selected unit.\n\nTo support this intention, UTBot offers a possibility to use symbolic stubs — stubs, which, when called, return a\nsymbolic value. Functions from units other than the tested one can be replaced with such stubs, and selected unit will\nbe tested, regarding that other units’ functions may return any value.\n\n```c++\nint process_temperature() {\n    int t = read_t_sensor();\n    if (t < 0) {\n        printf(\"Negative\");\n        return -1;\n    }\n    if (t < 30) {\n        printf(\"Comfortable\");\n        return 0;\n    }\n    printf(\"Too hot\");\n    return 1;\n}\n```\n\nAn example of using stubs. Consider a function above. If one wants to test various execution paths of\nprocess_temperature()\nfunction, their may not be interested in testing read_t_sensor()\nthat can address real physical device and require complex environment to setup.\n\nStub file description. Code example bellow presents UTBot stub file example. Its contents are not totally intuitive, because the\nsame stub files are used for generating tests (translate to LLVM bitcode and interpret by KLEE) and running them. When\nstubs are compiled to be passed to KLEE, KLEE_MODE=1 is assigned during compilation, so calling a stub from tested unit\nfor the first time would create a symbolic variable, and then this variable will be returned for every function call.\n\n```c++\n//automatically generated\nchar read_t_sensor_symbolic;\nchar read_t_sensor() {\nstatic int firstTimeCall = 1;\n#ifdef\nKLEE_MODE\nif (firstTimeCall == 1) {\nfirstTimeCall = 0;\nklee_make_symbolic(\n&read_t_sensor_symbolic,\nsizeof(read_t_sensor_symbolic),\n\"read_t_sensor_symbolic\");\n}\n//can be manually added\nklee_prefer_cex(read_t_sensor_symbolic == 0);\nklee_assume(read_t_sensor_symbolic > -273);\n#endif\n//automatically generated\nreturn read_t_sensor_symbolic;\n}\n```\n\nUTBot is capable of generating only simple stubs, which do not depend on their arguments, but it affords its users a\ngreat opportunity to modify stubs themselves, using a powerful [KLEE API](https://klee.github.io/docs/intrinsics/). This can be really helpful to add\nconstraints to program arguments and return value, making it look like a real function, but with the advantage of much\nfaster symbolic execution. Consider read_t_sensor(), which, in reality, should never return values below absolute zero.\nIf a function like read_t_sensor() needs to be stubbed, users can add a constraint to it, which will discard all the\nunwanted paths and make stub behavior closer to real function behavior. Moreover, users can apply a soft constraint to\nthe read_t_sensor() result to force the testing of a path where read_t_sensor() returns 0.\n\nFor each stub, a header is generated which contains symbols from user source file, needed for function signature\nsuccessful compilation. This includes structures, classes and type definitions.\n\n![Stubs linking behaviour for c-example project](https://github.com/UnitTestBot/unittestbot.github.io/raw/source/resources/images/stubsExample.png)\n\nGenerating tests with symbolic stubs. When UTBot generates tests, it provides an option to replace all project targets\nexcept the tested one with stubs. Prior to tests generation, UTBot creates a stub file for every source file in the\nproject. When the generation request specifies to use stubs, UTBot links all project targets except one not from source\nfiles, but from stub files. UTBot uses exactly the same commands for stubs compilation and linkage, as it would use for\nsource files. For example, when tests generation for helper.a with stubs is requested in c-example project, targets will\nbe replaced to stubs according to figure above.\n\nRunning tests with symbolic stubs. Apart from generated tests, UTBot also generates Makefiles(Section 3.9) to run them.\nThis Makefiles contains commands to build each test with or without stubs, and commands to run built test with/without\nstubs. When a test for function is generated using stubs, the test binary is linked with stub code. This time,\nKLEE_MODE=0 is passed and stub function simply returns a global variable, which is set in test body.

UTBot uses Z3 version 4.8.7 as\nSMT-solver for KLEE. Symbolic execution of each function under test issues a separate KLEE run, which symbolically\nexecutes the function wrapper generated by UTBot. UTBot gives KLEE a configurable amount of time to symbolically execute\ngiven bitcode, and, when it ends, sends KLEE a SIGINT signal, which is correctly handled by KLEE in many cases — the\nengine saves explored paths and finishes the execution. However, there are scenarios where KLEE does not handle SIGINTs\ncorrectly due to missing handlers in some parts of its code; so UTBot waits a specified amount of time and then sends\nstronger signals: SIGSTOP, and, eventually, SIGKILL.

UTBot runs KLEE with the following\nparameters:\n\n```shell\nklee --entry-point=klee_entry__max\n--libc=klee --posix-runtime --fp-runtime\n--only-output-states-covering-new \n--allocate-determ --external-calls=all \n--timer-interval=1s --bcov-check-interval=5s\n--disable-verify --output-dir=klee-out-dir\nbitcode.bc --sym-stdin 64\n```\n\nLet us explain every KLEE command line option passed by UTBot in detail:\n\n* KLEE is given a bitcode representation of a project target, which may contain many functions, so KLEE understands\n  where to begin symbolic execution by an entry-point option. To improve symbolic execution possibilities, KLEE needs to\n  be supplied with standard C library, i.e. libc, compiled into LLVM IR. There is a choice one can make between using\n  KLEE libc — a small set of libc functions shipped with KLEE itself,\n  or [klee-uclibc](https://github.com/klee/klee-uclibc), a more complete package, which can be linked with KLEE and used\n  during symbolic execution. Again (as with POSIX runtime), this KLEE libc or klee-uclibc library can be treated as\n  stubs that used by KLEE instead of real libc. UTBot uses KLEE libc. Despite that a wider set of functions is\n  implemented in klee-uclibc, using it forces KLEE to analyse additional several thousands of LLVM instructions prior to\n  analysing actual code of UTBot wrapper, consequently, slowing down UTBot test generation. It is understood that\n  coverage may be lost using –libc=klee instead of –libc=uclibc, so it is planned to make the libc selection\n  configurable;\n* UTBot uses KLEE POSIX runtime and self-developed floatingpoint runtime library to allow symbolic execution of programs\n  operating with file descriptors and floating-point values;\n* –only-output-states-covering-new option is used to not generate tests executing the same path in user functions;\n* UTBot allows all external calls to discard minimal number of branches. External call is a possibility of KLEE to\n  execute a function not implemented in LLVM IR. For that, function arguments are concretized, which potentially leads\n  to a coverage loss, but other options of handling external function calls, like killing an execution branch, are even\n  worse in terms of achieving maximal coverage;\n* timer-interval and self-invented bcov-check-interval are used to stop symbolic execution of branches not promising to\n  increase coverage;\n* UTBot allows

C/C++ projects usually consist\nof source files and headers, which are compiled and linked into libraries and executable files (while libraries can also\nbe linked to one another or other executables, forming a directed acyclic graph of project linkage). Executables and\nlibraries can be considered as the artifacts of project building. KLEE operates with [LLVM IR](???) so, to symbolically\nexecute code from a given product, UTBot needs the information about how the project is compiled and linked in order to\nbe able to recompile it into LLVM IR. UTBot is able to get this information from project build system via Bear\ntool [more info](compile-databasse). UTBot supports CMake and Makefile build systems.\n\nThen, UTBot analyses given sources using [clang-tooling](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/HowToSetupToolingForLLVM.html) to\nobtain C/C++ AST of files under test. Note that clang-tooling requires a compilation database to work. Essentially, a\ncompilation database is a structural representation of compile commands used to obtain C/C++ object files from project\nsources, and it is also retrieved from the build system by UTBot. UTBot treats functions as structural units of the\nproject and generates tests for them. In order to achieve this, UTBot creates symbolic wrappers called KLEE files for\nevery project source file, [more info](preparing-sources-for-klee), that use symbolic variables concept for symbolic\nexecution. Symbolic variables can be treated as logical constraints for variables, which are transformed into concrete\nvalues as the result of symbolic execution. Symbolic variables are the core of symbolic execution approach to software\nverification, and they are used in many successful tools for software verification and test generation.\n\nThen, UTBot uses information about project compilation and linkage to rebuild the project in LLVM\nbitcode [more info](linking-bitcode). This is done to pass the linkage result (.bc file) to KLEE. If a function calls\nother functions from the project, UTBot can provide KLEE with their bitcode as well, or, depending on user preferences,\nuse generated symbolic stubs for them [stubs](stubs).\n\nKLEE produces files that represent test cases for a given function, and UTBot parses and transforms them to C++ test\nfiles (For supported C/C++ features, see [c syntax](c-syntax), [c++ syntax](cpp-syntax)), which present the test cases\nwith [GoogleTest](https://google.github.io/googletest/) framework. UTBot also provides its users with a build system for\ngenerated tests, automatically compiling and linking them with project files. Users can run\ntests [more info](generating-and-running-tests) with a single click and see the results and coverage information in\nVSCode Panel. UTBot uses Makefiles for test runs [more info](incrementality), so UTBot tests can be used in continuous\nintegration.\n\n![UTBotCpp pipeline](https://github.com/UnitTestBot/unittestbot.github.io/raw/source/resources/images/pipelineUtbot.png)\n\nThe most important things are described below in sequential order.\n\n## Tests Generation\n\n1.

It\n   uses [LibTooling](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/LibTooling.html) for parsing source code, traversing types, etc.\n3. [SourceToHeaderRewriter](https://github.com/UnitTestBot/UTBotCpp/tree/main/server/src/clang-utils/SourceToHeaderRewriter.cpp)\n   generates headers (.h files) based on source (.c files).\n4. [FeaturesFilter](https://github.com/UnitTestBot/UTBotCpp/tree/main/server/src/FeaturesFilter.cpp) filters out all\n   methods except the ones listed in [supported syntax](c-syntax).\n5. [Synchronizer](https://github.com/UnitTestBot/UTBotCpp/tree/main/server/src/Synchronizer.cpp)\n   synchronizes [stubs](stubs) and wrappers for all files\n   in [compile_commands.json](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/JSONCompilationDatabase.html).\n6. [KleeGenerator](https://github.com/UnitTestBot/UTBotCpp/tree/main/server/src/KleeGenerator.cpp) generates klee files\n   as well as source files, also builds them in [bitcode](https://llvm.org/docs/BitCodeFormat.html) files.\n7. [Linker](https://github.com/UnitTestBot/UTBotCpp/tree/main/server/src/building/Linker.cpp) links bitcode files\n   together into module.\n8. [Linker](https://github.com/UnitTestBot/UTBotCpp/tree/main/server/src/building/Linker.cpp)\n   writes [Makefiles](makefiles).\n9. [KleeRunner](https://github.com/UnitTestBot/UTBotCpp/tree/main/server/src/KleeRunner.cpp)\n   runs [KLEE](https://klee.github.io/) on module consecutively for each method from request.\n10. [KleeGenerator](https://github.com/UnitTestBot/UTBotCpp/tree/main/server/src/KleeGenerator.cpp) parses output of\n    KLEE and writes files of [GoogleTest](https://github.com/google/googletest).\n11. [Server](install-server) sends final response to client and also transfers generated files for remote scenario.\n\n## Tests Running\n\nWhen user runs the tests, server performs various operations that might depend on the compiler used by the project.\n\n1.

Log data is written\ninto `logs` folder placed inside the docker container. The path in which folder is created can be managed by\npassing `--log /my/path` option to UnitTestBot binary. The default path for this option is the home\nfolder: `/home/{$USERNAME}/logs`.\n\nThe same principles are applied to the temporary directory `tmp`, in which the artifacts are placed and which path you\ncan control via `--tmp /my/path` option.\n\nThe `logs` folder structure is represented in the following way:\n\n* logs\n    * client1\n        * everything.log\n        * latest_readable.log\n        * project1\n            * stage1\n                * timestamp.log\n            * stage2\n                * timestamp.log\n        * project2\n    * client2\n    * everything.log\n    * latest_readable.log\n\nAs you can see, the server creates a subdirectory for each client. There are two files inside it: one of them stores\nevery log message written during the execution of the requests from this client, while the other stores **INFO** level\nlogs from the last session. There are **ERROR**, **WARNING**, **INFO** and **DEBUG** logging levels.\n\nBesides writing server log to files, UTBot sends the same logs to clients so they can be viewed in VS Code directly. You\ncan find them in a tab called **UTBot: Server Log**.\n\n![utbotServerLogImg](https://github.com/UnitTestBot/unittestbot.github.io/raw/source/resources/images/utbotServerLog.png)\n\nLogging level can be changed using the **UTBot: Log Settings** menu item.\n\n![logLevelGif](https://github.com/UnitTestBot/unittestbot.github.io/raw/source/resources/gifs/logLevel.gif)\n\n## Client logs\n\nClient logs monitors sent requests and received responses.

It is an IDE extension (the client) paired\nwith server application.\n\nThe tool uses [symbolic execution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_execution) for test cases generation. UTBot\nuses KLEE Symbolic Virtual Machine enchanced with a new advanced bidirectional symbolic execution algorithm developed by\nResearch Group from Saint Petersburg State University. Tests are generated in form\nof [Google Test Framework](https://github.com/google/googletest).\n\n## Tests Generation: Regression Suite\n\n**UnitTestBot** generates test cases by code, trying to cover maximum statements and execution paths. We treat source\ncode as *source of truth* assuming that behavior is correct (corresponds to initial user demand). Generated tests are\nplaced in the so-called ***regression suite***. Thus, we *fixate* current behavior by test cases.\n\nWhat is the purpose? You obtain **full control** of future code changes. Any code change now **can't break behavior\nsilently**. If developer changes the code, then some tests will fall on CI. Then, ther are two possible scenarios:\n\n* Initial behavior was <span style=\"color: green\"><b>correct</b></span> but developer <i>broke</i> it. And, as a result,\n  generated test helped to find a bug.\n* Initial behavior was <span style=\"color: red\"><b>incorrect</b></span> and developer <i>fixed</i> it. Then, test must\n  be manually updated to fixate new behavior.\n\nUTBot provides dramatic code quality improvement in the long term: after tests are generated no change can break\nbehavior without an alarm.\n\n## Test Generation: Errors Detection\n\nUnitTestBot is not only able to fixate the behavior in an existing code, but it also helps to find real bugs in your\nproject. Some code fragments might be invalid, while developers don't know about it. For example, buffer overflows,\nassertion failures, segmentation faults, and so on. If UTBot finds an execution path leading to such a situation, it\ncreates a special test case that is added to the so-called ***error suite***.\n\nWhile all tests from *regression suite* are *green* right after generation, tests from *error suite* are *red* (they\nfail if you run them). Such tests generated by UnitTestBot are a convenient way to discover critical problems as soon as\npossible. After developer fixes a bug, tests can be rerun to verify the problem is gone.\n\n## Code Coverage\n\nUTBot tries to generate test cases that:\n\n* maximize <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_coverage\">code coverage</a> (by statements and branches);\n* minimize number of tests, i.e. if you drop any test case from generated suite, your code coverage decreases.\n\nOf course, in an ideal world we would like to test **every** execution path of the program (so-called *path coverage*),\nbut the number of such paths is often infinite due to loops and recursion. UnitTestBot aims to maximize other types of\ncoverages: ***statement coverage***\nand ***branch coverage***, most commonly used as metrics for coverage quality assessment tools.\n\n","path":"/docs/cpp/general/home"},"72a73e73-65ad-5bde-9b3e-aa8efd36339a":{"name":"System Requirements","content":"\n# System Requirements and Supported Systems\n\n## Client Side\n\nThe plugin is available for VS Code (1.50+)\n\n## Server Side\n\n**Operating Systems**\n\nLinux : Ubuntu 18.04, 20.04\n\nWindows : WSL 1, 2 with Ubuntu 18.04+","path":"/docs/cpp/general/sys-requirements"},"46198669-2a54-5f67-9426-cdba96e43918":{"name":"Installing and Setting Up the UTBot Server","content":"\n# Installing and Setting Up the UTBot Server\n\nThis page provides a step-by-step instruction to install and run the **UTBot Server** on a Linux host.

You have two options to comfortably operate with those\nsources as well:\n\n* You can use VS Code with UTBot extension locally and synchronize files with files on UTBot server host. For that, we\n  recommend using VS Code [SFTP plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=liximomo.sftp).\n* You can Use VS Code [Remote-SSH](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh) feature to use VS Code with UTBot\n  extension on the same host that runs UTBot server.\n* You can operate UTBot Server via its [Command Line Interface](command-line-interface).\n\n## Using VS Code extension\n\nLet's suppose you opened your sources folder with VS Code with UTBot extension. It does not matter if that happened on\nthe same host with UTBot Server or on another one. In any case, you will see [UTBot Wizard](wizard) which will help you\nto set up your project for UTBot.\n\nFirstly, it will ask for an IP and port to look for the UTBot Server. You can specify `localhost` if it is the same\nmachine or an IP of the machine that runs UTBot Server.\n\nThen, UTBot Wizard will ask for a path to look for sources, and you should specify a path on the host that runs UTBot\nServer. If you are on the same machine, then use your path, else use the path of the folder which you sync to.\n\nAfter that, you should specify build folder of your project which contains build artifacts that UTBot uses to generate\nand build test files. If the project is not build yet, you can try to configure it automatically by clicking\nnotifications that UTBot will send.\n\nAfter you complete the UTBot Wizard, you should be ready to experience UTBot capabilities!\n\n![wizardInstallGif](https://github.com/UnitTestBot/unittestbot.github.io/raw/source/resources/gifs/wizardInstall.gif)\n\n## Using Command Line Interface\n\nThis case is much simpler: you can stop the UTBot Server and invoke it as specified in\nin [CLI overview](command-line-interface).

SARIF format is JSON-based. We can use SARIF reports in products that support showing directly or with plugins.  GitHub or Visual Studio Code are good examples.\n\n## Using with GitHub\nYou can generate code analysis information from UTBotCpp for the entire project or selected folder or set of file, selected by pattern.  The [UTBot-Action](https://github.com/UnitTestBot/UTBotCpp-action) makes this generation for you. Code analyzer information and tests are generated in correspondent folders  and stored new project branch with name - ``utbot-code-analysis-[short-commit-hash]``. The action makes a pull request to a branch from which you launched the action. \n\nHow-to steps:\n\n* Allow [UTBot-Action](https://github.com/UnitTestBot/UTBotCpp-action) to make a pull request in your repository by the ``Settings > Actions > Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests`` command:\n\n![Permission](https://github.com/UnitTestBot/unittestbot.github.io/raw/source/resources/images/utbot-cpp-wiki/cpp-ca-PermissionForCreatingAndApprovingPullRequest.png)\n\n* Make a folder `.github/workflows` in your GitHub repository and create a file with `.yml` extension, for example `run-utbot.yml`\n\n* In created YML file you have to add one more permission  `permissions: write-all` and after that you can use UTBot Action in your repository action. Here is  an example that runs UTBotCpp analysis for a whole project: \n``` yml\nname: \"UTBot code analysis\"\n\non:\n  workflow_dispatch:\n    \njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    permissions: write-all\n    steps:\n    - name: UTBot code analysis\n      uses: UnitTestBot/UTBotCpp-action@v2022.06.0\n      with:\n        add_tests: 'true'\n        refresh_tests: 'false'\n        utbot_version: '2022.06.0'\n        scope: 'project'\n```\nNewly created action  runs on ``workflow_dispatch``,  so for launching the action push the\n``Actions > Select workflow > UTBot code analysis (or your workflow name) > Run workflow > Run workflow`` button in GitHub UI:\n\n![RunAction](https://github.com/UnitTestBot/unittestbot.github.io/raw/source/resources/images/utbot-cpp-wiki/cpp-ca-RunAction.png)\n\n* As a result, the [UTBot-Action](https://github.com/UnitTestBot/UTBotCpp-action) action creates  a pull request from new ``utbot-code-analysis-[short-commit-hash]`` branch to a branch from which you run. In action-created branch there are two new folders. The first folder contains generated tests, the second - analysis results. The structure of the folder with analysis information  repeats the structure of project source folder and contains SARIF file report for each source file in corresponded sub folder. Additionally an aggregated SARIF report is created for a whole project (`project_code_analysis.sarif`)  . This aggregated report contains information about all project files and can be used for highlighting errors in the project scope.\n\n* To view the result of code analysis you have to go to the ``Security > Code scanning alerts`` tab.  By selection of security report item, you see the trace of detected problem, which starts from a test case.\n\n![ShowAllerts](https://github.com/UnitTestBot/unittestbot.github.io/raw/source/resources/images/utbot-cpp-wiki/cpp-ca-ShowAllerts.png)\n\n## Using with Visual Studio Code\n\nWe are suggest that you are have properly installed UTBot plugin.\n\n How-to steps:\n\n* To use UTBot Code Analyzer you have to run the ``File > Preferences > Settings (or Ctrl + ,)`` page, then navigate to the ``Extensions > UnitTestBot`` tab and turn on SARIF generation.\n![TurnOnSarifGeneration](https://github.com/UnitTestBot/unittestbot.github.io/raw/source/resources/images/utbot-cpp-wiki/cpp-ca-TurnOnSarifGeneration.png)\n* After [generating tests](https://github.com/UnitTestBot/UTBotCpp/wiki/generating-tests) in your project there are two new folders.

The command options can be viewed\nvia `./utbot server --help`.\n\n```sh\nuser@laptop:~$ ./utbot server --help\nLaunch UTBot server.\nUsage: ./utbot server [OPTIONS]\n\nOptions:\n  -h,--help                   Print this help message and exit\n  --help-all                  Expand all help\n  -p,--port UINT              Port server run on.\n  -j UINT                     Maximum number of threads per user.\n  --tmp TEXT                  Path to temporary folder.\n  --log TEXT                  Path to folder with logs.\n  -v,--verbosity  ENUM:value in {debug|error|info|trace|warning}:value in {debug->1,error->-2,info->0,trace->9,warning->-1} OR {1,-2,0,9,-1}\n                              Logger verbosity.\n```\n\n### Examples\n\nLet us provide with several examples of how you can run UnitTestBot executable in server mode.\n\nIn case you are fine with default settings you can avoid passing parameters and just run executable.\n\n```sh\nuser@laptop:~$ ./utbot\n```\n\nIf you want to be more specific in terms of your settings (e.g., change port and log folder), run it accordingly:\n\n```sh\nuser@laptop:~$ ./utbot --port 2130 --log \"/home/utbot/logs\".\n```\n\n## Generate Command\n\nIf you want to generate tests for the source code, you need to use `generate` subcommand. The command options can be\nviewed via `./utbot generate --help`.\n\n```sh\nuser@laptop:~$ ./utbot generate --help\nGenerate unit tests and/or stubs.\nUsage: ./utbot generate [OPTIONS] SUBCOMMAND\n\nOptions:\n  -h,--help                   Print this help message and exit\n  --help-all                  Expand all help\n[Option Group: Project context]\n  Options:\n    -p,--project-path TEXT REQUIRED\n                                Path to testing project root.\n    -t,--tests-dir TEXT=tests   Relative path to directory in which tests will be generated.\n    -b,--build-dir TEXT=build   Relative path to build directory with compile_commands.json and/or coverage.json.\n[Option Group: Settings context]\n  Options:\n    -g,--generate-for-static    True, if you want UTBot to generate tests for static functions.\n    -v,--verbose                Set if Five Rules Standard is required.\n    --timeout INT=30            Maximum time (in seconds) is allowed for generation tests per function. Set to non-positive number to disable it.\n    --no-deterministic-searcher Use deterministic searcher to traverse bitcode in the same way every time. It may significantly slow down generation.\n    --no-stubs                  True, if you don’t want UTBot to use generated stubs from <testsDir>/stubs folder instead real files.\n\nSubcommands:\n  project                     Generate tests for C project.\n  stubs                       Generate stubs for project.\n  folder                      Generate tests for folder.\n  file                        Generate tests for file in project.\n  snippet                     Generate tests for code snippet.\n  function                    Generate tests for function.\n  class                       Generate tests for C++ class.\n  line                        Generate tests for line in file.\n  assertion                   Generate tests that fails assertion.\n  predicate                   Generate tests with given result.\n```\n\nThe command provides other subcommands, that specify test generation mode. It's required to use one. These subcommands\nmay require additional options (i.e., `--line-number`) in order to run them. Existing options can be displayed\nvia `./utbot generate [SUBCOMMAND] --help`. You can also check them via global `--help-all` option.\n\nGenerated tests can be found in a test folder (`tests` subfolder in the project directory by default).\n\n### Examples\n\nBelow we demonstrate several examples of how to run generation commands.\n\n**Generate tests for snippet**\n\n```sh\nuser@laptop:~$ ./utbot generate --project-path \"/home/snippets/\" snippet --file-path \"home/snippets/snippet.c\"\n```\n\nHere, `--project-path` is path to the parent directory of the given snippet file  `snippet.c`.\n\n**Generate tests for project**\n\n```sh\nuser@laptop:~$ ./utbot generate --project-path \"/home/projects/c-project\" project\n```\n\n**Generate tests for function**\n\n```sh\nuser@laptop:~$ ./utbot generate --project-path \"/home/projects/c-project\" function --file-path /home/projects/c-project/complex_structs.c --line-number 39\n```\n\n**Generate tests with prompted result**\n\n```sh\nuser@laptop:~$ ./utbot generate --project-path \"/home/projects/c-project/\"  predicate --file-path \"/home/projects/c-project/basic_functions.c\" --line-number 5 --predicate == --return-value 11 --validation-type int32\n```\n\n## Run Command\n\nOne of the main features of UnitTestBot that allows to run tests with coverage is available in CLI mode as well. In\norder to run the tests, type in the following command: `./utbot run [OPTIONS] [SUBCOMMAND] [SUBCOMMAND OPTIONS]>`.\nSubcommand in this case specifies whether to run all generated tests, tests in one file, or just one specific test.\n\n```sh\nuser@laptop:~$ ./utbot run --help\nLaunch unit tests and generate coverage info.\nUsage: ./utbot run [OPTIONS] [SUBCOMMAND]\n\nOptions:\n  -h,--help                   Print this help message and exit\n  --help-all                  Expand all help\n[Option Group: Project context]\n  Options:\n    -p,--project-path TEXT REQUIRED\n                                Path to testing project root.\n    -t,--tests-dir TEXT=tests   Relative path to directory in which tests will be generated.\n    -b,--build-dir TEXT=build   Relative path to build directory with compile_commands.json and/or coverage.json.\n[Option Group: Settings context]\n  Options:\n    -g,--generate-for-static    True, if you want UTBot to generate tests for static functions.\n    -v,--verbose                Set if Five Rules Standard is required.\n    --timeout INT=30            Maximum time (in seconds) is allowed for generation tests per function. Set to non-positive number to disable it.\n    --no-deterministic-searcher Use deterministic searcher to traverse bitcode in the same way every time. It may significantly slow down generation.\n    --no-stubs                  True, if you don’t want UTBot to use generated stubs from <testsDir>/stubs folder instead real files.\n\nSubcommands:\n  test                        Run specified test\n  file                        Run all tests in specified file\n  project                     Run all tests for this project\n```\n\nSimiliarly to `generate` subcommands, you can access manual for `run` subcommands via `./utbot run [SUBCOMMAND] --help`.\n\n### Examples\n\n**Run all tests for project**\n\n```sh\nuser@laptop:~$ ./utbot run --project-path \"/home/projects/c-project\" project\n```\n\n**Run test file**\n\n```sh\nuser@laptop:~$ ./utbot run --project-path \"/home/projects/c-project\" file --file-path \"home/projects/c-project/tests/basic_functions_test.cpp\"  \n```\n\n**Run specific test**\n\n```sh\nuser@laptop:~$ ./utbot run --project-path \"/home/projects/c-project\" test --file-path \"/home/projects/c-project/tests/basic_functions_test.cpp\" --test-suite \"regression\" --test-name \"max__test_1\"\n```\n\n## All Command\n\nFor simplicity, UTBot CLI provides `all` command, that firstly generates stubs for the project, then generates project\ntests and finally runs them with coverage.\n\n```sh\nuser@laptop:~$ ./utbot all --help\nSequential launch of 'generate stubs' -> 'generate project' -> 'run'.\nUsage: ./utbot all [OPTIONS]\n\nOptions:\n  -h,--help                   Print this help message and exit\n  --help-all                  Expand all help\n  --no-coverage BOOLEAN       Flag that controls coverage generation.\n  -s,--src-paths TEXT         Relative paths to directories, containing source files. Separate each path with comma.\n[Option Group: Project context]\n  Options:\n    -p,--project-path TEXT REQUIRED\n                                Path to testing project root.\n    -t,--tests-dir TEXT=tests   Relative path to directory in which tests will be generated.\n    -b,--build-dir TEXT=build   Relative path to build directory with compile_commands.json and/or coverage.json.\n[Option Group: Settings context]\n  Options:\n    -g,--generate-for-static    True, if you want UTBot to generate tests for static functions.\n    -v,--verbose                Set if Five Rules Standard is required.\n    --timeout INT=30            Maximum time (in seconds) is allowed for generation tests per function. Set to non-positive number to disable it.\n    --no-deterministic-searcher Use deterministic searcher to traverse bitcode in the same way every time. It may significantly slow down generation.\n    --no-stubs                  True, if you don’t want UTBot to use generated stubs from <testsDir>/stubs folder instead real files.\n```\n\n### Examples\n\n```sh\nuser@laptop:~$ ./utbot all --project-path \"/home/projects/c-project\"\n```\n\n","path":"/docs/cpp/usage/cli"},"e38da8ca-7284-5d62-accd-d8b80aef50d6":{"name":"Configuring Project","content":"\n# Configuring Project\n\nWhen you initialize your C project with UTBot Wizard, extension will suggest you to configure project. Also, you may\nconfigure project afterwards using command `UTBot: Configure project` or `UTBot: Reset cache and configure project` in\npallet.\n\n## Project Configuration Steps\n\n### Check Build Folder for exist\n\nFirstly, if build folder is missing, extension will offer you to create that. In case you haven't done it yet, you may\nclick `Create build folder` button. UTBot will create that on host machine (as well as `bear.sh` script within).\n\n![configureCheckBuildFolderImg](https://github.com/UnitTestBot/unittestbot.github.io/raw/source/resources/images/configureCheckBuildFolder.png)\n\n### Export Project Model\n\nThen, you will be asked to configure project. In case you haven't done it yet, you may click 'Configure' button. UTBot\nwill call `cmake` command for CMake project. It also will pass root directory and CMake options specified in wizard.\nNext, regardless of project's type UTBot will try to call `./bear.sh make` from build directory. If everything is\nsuccessful, two files will be created in build directory `compile_commands.json` and `link_commands.json`. Or,\nalternatively, you may run `./bear.sh` from create build directory with your build command as argument. For\nexample, `./bear.sh make -j8`.\n\n![configureExportProjectModelImg](https://github.com/UnitTestBot/unittestbot.github.io/raw/source/resources/images/configureExportProjectModel.png)\n\n> 📝**Note**\n>\n> Script `bear.sh` is just a wrapper around [Bear](https://github.com/UnitTestBot/Bear) tool.\n","path":"/docs/cpp/usage/configuring"},"a5ad9795-cf3e-5e4e-9f4c-52750ff4265e":{"name":"Docker-free UTBot in WSL2","content":"\n# Docker-free UTBot in WSL2\n\nIf you have a project on Windows you may like to use lightweight solution for the UTBot that is based on WSL2 virtualization approach.\n\nPlease, be sure that you have an ability to install the WSL2 in you Windows 10 or 11. \nMaybe you need the upgrade Windows 10 to the latest version \nand the [Windows 10 Upgrade Assistance](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/windows-10-update-assistant-3550dfb2-a015-7765-12ea-fba2ac36fb3f) \nis the best way to go.\n\nIn the simplest variant you need to create an empty WSL2 container with recommended version of Ubuntu (currently it is **Ubuntu 18.04**)\nThat can be done by command (may need administrator privileges):\n```\nPS C:\\Users\\user>wsl --install -d Ubuntu-18.04\n```\n\nAfter the installation you have initial setup for WSL2 user (just for unification we recommend name it 'utbot'):\n```bash\nInstalling, this may take a few minutes...\nPlease create a default UNIX user account. The username does not need to match your Windows username.\nFor more information visit: https://aka.ms/wslusers\nEnter new UNIX username: utbot\nEnter new UNIX password:\nRetype new UNIX password:\npasswd: password updated successfully\nInstallation successful!\nTo run a command as administrator (user \"root\"), use \"sudo <command>\".\nSee \"man sudo_root\" for details.\n\nutbot@userhwlp:~$\n```\n\nAt this point the WSL2 initial container installation is finished. \nBy default new UTBot WSL2 container is called **Ubuntu-18.04**.\n```PowerShell\nPS C:\\Users\\u00663918> wsl --list --verbose\n  NAME                   STATE           VERSION\n  Ubuntu-18.04           Running         2      <---------- Newly installed WSL2 container   \n```\nNow you need to install the UTBot server in it.\n\nFor the common case this step is described in the [install server](https://github.com/UnitTestBot/UTBotCpp/wiki/install-server)\ndocument, but this simplified WSL2 installation has some specifics and is described below.\n\n## Step by step UTBot server installation and the first run\n**Hint**: you can skip this section by running the script from home **utbot** folder:\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\n#please, change UTBOT_VERSION value to the latest version from https://github.com/UnitTestBot/UTBotCpp/releases\nexport UTBOT_VERSION=\"1.0.167\" \n\nmkdir utbotcpp\ncd utbotcpp\nwget https://github.com/UnitTestBot/UTBotCpp/releases/download/v$UTBOT_VERSION/utbot-release-$UTBOT_VERSION.zip\nsudo apt-get install unzip\nunzip utbot-release-$UTBOT_VERSION.zip\ntar -xvzf utbot_distr.tar.gz\nchmod +x unpack_and_run_utbot.sh \nsudo ./unpack_and_run_utbot.sh\n```\n \n  \n* You need to check the latest version of UTBot from [release artifacts](https://github.com/UnitTestBot/UTBotCpp/releases).\n  Please, find the URL of artifacts that is taken from **Assets**. As an example: [https://github.com/UnitTestBot/UTBotCpp/releases/download/v1.0.167/utbot-release-1.0.167.zip](https://github.com/UnitTestBot/UTBotCpp/releases/download/v1.0.167/utbot-release-1.0.167.zip).\n  Here \"1.0.167\" is the latest version at the time of writing.\n* Make the directory for UTBotCpp \n  ```bash\n  utbot@userhwlp:~$ mkdir utbotcpp \n  ```\n* Go into created directory utbotcpp\n  ```bash\n  utbot@userhwlp:~$ cd utbotcpp \n  ```\n* Download archive from release artifacts\n  ```bash\n  utbot@userhwlp:~/utbotcpp$ wget https://github.com/UnitTestBot/UTBotCpp/releases/download/v1.0.167/utbot-release-1.0.167.zip\n  ```\n* Unarchive downloaded zip (install unzip `sudo apt-get install unzip` first!)\n  ```bash\n  utbot@userhwlp:~/utbotcpp$ unzip utbot-release-1.0.167.zip\n  ```\n* Unpack tar \n  ```bash\n  utbot@userhwlp:~/utbotcpp$ tar -xvzf utbot_distr.tar.gz\n  ```\n* Install and run server under the `root`\n  ```bash\n  utbot@userhwlp:~/utbotcpp$ sudo chmod +x unpack_and_run_utbot.sh && ./unpack_and_run_utbot.sh\n  ```\n  **NB!** UTBot need to be run under the root to get an access to Windows File System with necessary privileges. \n\nTo run correctly UTBot server needs well-configured build-related and `gcc-9` packages.\nYou can do it by running the following script:\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\nsudo apt-get update -y\nsudo apt-get upgrade -y\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade -y\nsudo apt-get install build-essential software-properties-common -y\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test -y\nsudo apt-get update -y\nsudo apt-get install gcc-9 g++-9 -y\nsudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gcc gcc /usr/bin/gcc-9 60 --slave /usr/bin/g++ g++ /usr/bin/g++-9\nsudo update-alternatives --config gcc\n```\n## Restart UTBot server\nThere are several ways to restart the UTBot server:\n* Restart UTBot server only. You can do it by the command from home directory of `utbot` user inside WSL2 container:\n  ```bash\n  utbot@userhwlp:~$ sudo ~/utbotcpp/utbot_distr/utbot_server_restart.sh\n  ```\n* Restart WSL2 subsystem from PowerShell command line\n  ```PowerShell\n  PS C:\\Users\\u00663918> wsl --terminate Ubuntu-18.04\n  ```\n  After that you need to run WSL2 container **Ubuntu-18.04** again and start the server by internal script\n  ```bash\n  utbot@userhwlp:~$ sudo ~/utbotcpp/utbot_distr/utbot_server_restart.sh\n  ```\n## VC UTBot plugin setup\nDue to single FS project organization you don't need synchronize the project source on Windows with WSL2 UTBot server.\nAs a result you don't need SFTP plugin.\nWhile mandatory setup of UTBot plugin (Run UTBot: Quickstart wizard) you need \n* `Connection` step:\n  - Type `localhost` in **Host**  field (**NB!** not `127.0.0.1`, not a temporary IP address that will change each time the WSL2 container is started)\n  - Type `2121` in **Port**  field\n* `Remote Path` step:\n  Type `/mnt/d/dev/c-example-my-vc` for windows project from  `d:\\dev\\c-example-my-vc` in **Remote Path** field\n\nThat is all!\nGood luck!","path":"/docs/cpp/usage/docker-free-utbot-in-wsl2"},"478c81d9-666f-5151-94cb-23e92cf0a396":{"name":"Formatting Tests","content":"\n# Formatting Tests\n\nUnitTestBot supports two formatting styles for generated tests:\n\n* **Short form**: so-called \"one-liners\", concise checks that are suitable for utility functions with many branches to\n  cover;\n* **Verbose form**: parameters declarations, expected and actual values, the function call are placed on separated\n  lines (aka \"Five Rules Standard\").

Right mouse click on VS Code Explorer;\n2. Select `UTBot: Generate Tests for Project`.\n\n![projectGif](https://github.com/UnitTestBot/unittestbot.github.io/raw/source/resources/gifs/project.gif)\n\n> 📝**Note**\n>\n> It can take some time to analyze a big project. If you see a pop-up message at the right bottom corner of the IDE window, it means analysis is still in progress.\n> Once code analysis is completed, a test folder will be created.\n\n## Generating Tests for Folder\n\nYou can generate tests for the folder.\n\n**How-to steps**:\n\n1. Right mouse click on VS Code Explorer;\n2. Select `UTBot: Generate Tests for Folder`;\n3. Specify the path to the folder you want to generate tests for.\n\n![folderGif](https://github.com/UnitTestBot/unittestbot.github.io/raw/source/resources/gifs/folder.gif)\n\n## Generating Tests for File\n\nYou can generate tests for a `'*.c'` file.\n\n> 📝**Note**\n>\n> It's worth to note only public functions (declared in a corresponding header file) are considered as targets for tests.\n\n**How-to steps**:\n\n1. Right mouse click to a target source file;\n2. Select `UTBot: Generate Tests... for Current File`.\n\n![file.Gif](https://github.com/UnitTestBot/unittestbot.github.io/raw/source/resources/gifs/file.gif)\n\nOnce code analysis is completed, a test folder with test named according convention `test_%filename%.cpp` will be\ncreated. Now you can sync local and remote environments, recompile the project and run tests.\n\n## Generating Tests for Function\n\nGenerate tests for a particular function is also possible.\n\n**How-to steps**:\n\n1. Move the caret inside function body;\n2. Right mouse click to a text editor;\n3. Select `UTBot: Generate Tests... > for Current Function`.\n\n![functionGif](https://github.com/UnitTestBot/unittestbot.github.io/raw/source/resources/gifs/function.gif)\n\nOnce code analysis is completed, a test folder with test named according convention `test_%filename%.cpp` will be\ncreated. Now you can sync local and remote environments, recompile the project and run tests.\n\n## Generating Tests for Line\n\nIt's even possible to cover a particular branch instead of entire function.\n\n**How-to steps**:\n\n1. Move the caret to a line you're going to cover by a test;\n2. Right mouse click to a text editor;\n3. Select `UTBot: Generate Tests... > for Current Line`.\n\n![lineGif](https://github.com/UnitTestBot/unittestbot.github.io/raw/source/resources/gifs/line.gif)\n\nOnce code analysis is completed, a test folder with a test file named according convention `test_%filename%.cpp` will be\ncreated. Now you can sync local and remote environments, recompile the project and the run test.\n\n## Generating Tests with Prompted Result\n\nIf you need to find parameters for which a function returns a specific output, you may find this UTBot feature extremely\nuseful.\n\n> 📝**Note**\n>\n> In general, UTBot **is not able to solve NP-hard problems**, that's why it is meaningless to use this feature on, for example, hash functions.\n\n**How-to steps**:\n\n1. Move the caret inside a function body;\n2. Right mouse click to a text editor;\n3.

It means that for each\nfile in your project UTBot generates file which contains all non-static functions signatures from the source file. Stubs\ncan be used as substitutes for calling functions from another module. Consider the following project structure:\n\n```\nexecutable\n|---- lib1.a\n|     |---- A.c\n|     +---- B.c\n|---- lib2.a\n|     |---- C.c\n```\n\nIf we run test generation for `C.c`, all functions from `lib1.a` will be replaced with their stubs on build step. So, if\nthe function `foo` from `C.c` calls the function `bar` from `A.c`, then stub for the function `bar` will be invoked\ninstead. Note that you can still generate tests using the exact definition of `bar`; for that, you will need to\nunmark `Use Stubs` checkbox in [settings](vscode-extension-settings#use-stubs).\n\n### Stub file example\n\nStub files can be found in `tests/stubs` folder. This is an example of stub file generated\nfor `c-example/lib/dependent_functions.c` from\nthe [example project](https://github.com/UnitTestBot/UTBotCpp/tree/main/integration-tests/c-example):\n\n```cpp\n// 1624618650000000000\n// Please, do not change the line above\n\n#ifdef\nKLEE_MODE\nextern void klee_make_symbolic(void *addr, unsigned long long nbytes, const char *name);\n#endif\n#include\n\"dependent_functions_stub.h\"\n\n#define\nNULL ((void*)0)\n\nint double_max_symbolic;\nint double_max(int a, int b) {\nstatic int firstTimeCall = 1;\n#ifdef\nKLEE_MODE\nif (firstTimeCall == 1) {\nfirstTimeCall = 0;\nklee_make_symbolic(&double_max_symbolic, sizeof(double_max_symbolic), \"double_max_symbolic\");\n}\n#endif\nreturn double_max_symbolic;\n}\n\n```\n\nThe first line contains timestamp of stub file creation. It is required for synchronization with the source code, so,\nplease, do not modify this line:\n\n```cpp\n// 1619438023000000000\n```\n\nThen, if a `KLEE_MODE` macro is passed during preprocessing, we add a KLEE declaration to allow us to use symbolic\nreturn value. `KLEE_MODE` serves for both test generation and test running purposes.\n\n```cpp\n#ifdef KLEE_MODE\nextern void klee_make_symbolic(void *addr, unsigned long long nbytes, const char *name);\n#endif\n```\n\nThis variable stores return value of the stub function:\n\n```cpp\nint double_max_symbolic;\n```\n\nStub function signature is always the same as the signature of the source function. If it's not (for example, if the\nfunction was modified), then UTBot will synchronize them by rewriting stub function with the new one:\n\n```cpp\nint double_max(int a, int b)\n```\n\nIf UTBot uses stubs, then `KLEE_MODE` is defined, and the return value is made symbolic. This way KLEE can decide what\nvalues to return to satisfy the execution paths:\n\n```cpp\nstatic int firstTimeCall = 1;\n#ifdef KLEE_MODE\n    if (firstTimeCall == 1) {\n        firstTimeCall = 0;\n        klee_make_symbolic(&double_max_symbolic, sizeof(double_max_symbolic), \"double_max_symbolic\");\n    }\n#endif\n```\n\n### Stub headers\n\nFor each stub, a header is generated. It contains definitions of types and structures used in function headers, allowing\nstubs to be compilable. Stub headers may contain definitions fetched from system headers and may look obscure, but\nusually you will not modify them.\n\n> 📝**Note**\n>\n> You can change the stub function body however you want. UTBot saves custom code inside the function while synchronizing. However, if the source function signature changes, then stub function will be completely rewritten.\n\n### Tests with stubs\n\nFor the tests that use stubs, the return values are generated in a such way that the code coverage is maximized. For\nexample:\n\n```cpp\nextern \"C\" char pointerToPointer_symbolic;\n\nTEST(regression, calc_two_numbers_f_test_1)\n{\n    // Initialize symbolic stubs\n    pointerToPointer_symbolic = '\\x10';\n\n    // Construct input\n    char a = 'c';\n    char b = 'p';\n\n    // Expected output\n    int expected = 2;\n\n    // Trigger the function\n    int actual = calc_two_numbers_f(a, b);\n\n    // Check results\n    EXPECT_EQ(expected, actual);\n}\n\nTEST(regression, calc_two_numbers_f_test_2)\n{\n    // Initialize symbolic stubs\n    pointerToPointer_symbolic = 'b';\n\n    // Construct input\n    char a = 'c';\n    char b = 'b';\n\n    // Expected output\n    int expected = 1;\n\n    // Trigger the function\n    int actual = calc_two_numbers_f(a, b);\n\n    // Check results\n    EXPECT_EQ(expected, actual);\n}\n```\n\nHere `pointerToPointer_symbolic` stores return value for `pointerToPointer` stub function.\n\n### Modifying stubs\n\nAs it was noted, it is easy to rewrite UTBot stubs into anything you want them to be. You should modify only function\nbodies and not touch header include, or `KLEE_MODE` ifdefs. Consider the simplest example:\n\n```cpp\n// 1624618650000000000\n// Please, do not change the line above\n\n#ifdef\nKLEE_MODE\nextern void klee_make_symbolic(void *addr, unsigned long long nbytes, const char *name);\n#endif\n#include\n\"dependent_functions_stub.h\"\n\n#define\nNULL ((void*)0)\n\nint double_max_symbolic;\nint double_max(int a, int b) {\nreturn a;\n}\n```\n\nIn such a case, UTBot will generate tests for functions from other CMake modules implying\nthat `double_max(int a, int b) = a`.\n\nHowever, you can also use symbolic variable power when modifying stubs. Suppose that you want your function not to\nreturn any value, but perform some checks on the arguments prior to that. Also, there may be a special case in that\nfunction that is highly important to be reflected in the stub. In that case, you can insert those checks in the stub,\nand, if they succeed, return a symbolic value:\n\n```cpp\n// 1624618650000000000\n// Please, do not change the line above\n\n#ifdef\nKLEE_MODE\nextern void klee_make_symbolic(void *addr, unsigned long long nbytes, const char *name);\n#endif\n#include\n\"dependent_functions_stub.h\"\n\n#define\nNULL ((void*)0)\n\nint double_max_symbolic;\nint double_max(int a, int b) {\nif (a == 100 && a > b) {\nreturn 100;\n}\nstatic int firstTimeCall = 1;\n#ifdef\nKLEE_MODE\nif (firstTimeCall == 1) {\nfirstTimeCall = 0;\nklee_make_symbolic(&double_max_symbolic, sizeof(double_max_symbolic), \"double_max_symbolic\");\n}\n#endif\nreturn double_max_symbolic;\n}\n```\n\nBy this change, `double_max(a, b)` will preserve its behaviour if a certain condition holds. This principle can be used\nto achieve the similarity of the stub and the original code while leaving out big parts of code.","path":"/docs/cpp/usage/stubs"},"9caf3b27-7b87-5464-b747-3bd489946b27":{"name":"VS Code Extension Settings","content":"\n# VS Code Extension Settings\n\nUnitTestBot extension for VSCode provides flexibility in its configuration.
