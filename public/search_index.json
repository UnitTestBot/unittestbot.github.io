The server generates logs and temporary files while tests generation. Client logs monitor requests sent to server and received responses.","content":"\nimport UTBotServerLog from '/resources/images/utbotServerLog.png';\nimport UTBotClientLog from '/resources/images/utbotServerLog.png';\nimport changeLogLevel from '/resources/gifs/logLevel.gif';\n\n# UTBot logging principles\n\n## Server log\nThe server generates two types of data: logs and temporary files needed to generate tests. Log data is written into `logs` folder placed inside the docker container. The path in which folder is created can be managed by passing `--log /my/path` option to UnitTestBot binary. The default path for this option is the home folder: `/home/{$USERNAME}/logs`.\n\nThe same principles are applied to the temporary directory `tmp`, in which the artifacts are placed and which path you can control via `--tmp /my/path` option.\n\nThe `logs` folder structure is represented in the following way:\n\n* logs\n    * client1\n        * everything.log\n        * latest_readable.log\n        * project1\n            * stage1\n                * timestamp.log\n            * stage2\n                * timestamp.log\n        * project2\n    * client2\n    * everything.log\n    * latest_readable.log\n\nAs you can see, the server creates a subdirectory for each client. There are two files inside it: one of them stores every log message written during the execution of the requests from this client, while the other stores **INFO** level logs from the last session. There are **ERROR**, **WARNING**, **INFO** and **DEBUG** logging levels.\n\nBesides writing server log to files, UTBot sends the same logs to clients so they can be viewed in VS Code directly. You can find them in a tab called **UTBot: Server Log**.\n\n<img src={UTBotServerLog} className=\"demoImg\"/>\n\nLogging level can be changed using the **UTBot: Log Settings** menu item.\n\n<img src={changeLogLevel} className=\"usageGif\"/>\n\n## Client logs\n\nClient logs monitors sent requests and received responses.

The most important things are described below in sequential order.\n\n1. [Client](/docs/cpp/installation/installing-the-vs-code-plugin) sends request (one of [types](/docs/cpp/usage/generating)) \nto [server](/docs/cpp/installation/installing-the-utbot-server). \nThe [corresponding](https://rnd-gitlab-msc.huawei.com/unittestbot/UnitTestBot/-/tree/master/UTBotCpp/server/src/testgens) object aggregates requests' information.\n2. [Fetcher](https://rnd-gitlab-msc.huawei.com/unittestbot/UnitTestBot/-/tree/master/UTBotCpp/server/src/fetchers/Fetcher.cpp) fetches types, methods, global variable usages, array usages, includes for all files in request. \nIt uses [LibTooling](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/LibTooling.html) for parsing source code, traversing types, etc.\n3. [SourceToHeaderRewriter](https://rnd-gitlab-msc.huawei.com/unittestbot/UnitTestBot/-/tree/master/UTBotCpp/server/src/clang-utils/SourceToHeaderRewriter.cpp) generates headers (.h files) based on source (.c files).\n4. [FeaturesFilter](https://rnd-gitlab-msc.huawei.com/unittestbot/UnitTestBot/-/tree/master/UTBotCpp/server/src/FeaturesFilter.cpp) filters out all methods except the ones listed in [supported syntax](/docs/cpp/advanced/syntax).\n5. [Synchronizer](https://rnd-gitlab-msc.huawei.com/unittestbot/UnitTestBot/-/tree/master/UTBotCpp/server/src/Synchronizer.cpp) synchronizes [stubs](/docs/cpp/usage/stubs) and wrappers for all files in [compile_commands.json](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/JSONCompilationDatabase.html).\n6. [KleeGenerator](https://rnd-gitlab-msc.huawei.com/unittestbot/UnitTestBot/-/tree/master/UTBotCpp/server/src/KleeGenerator.cpp) generates klee files as well as source files, also builds them in [bitcode](https://llvm.org/docs/BitCodeFormat.html) files.\n7. [Linker](https://rnd-gitlab-msc.huawei.com/unittestbot/UnitTestBot/-/tree/master/UTBotCpp/server/src/building/Linker.cpp) links bitcode files together into module.\n8. [Linker](https://rnd-gitlab-msc.huawei.com/unittestbot/UnitTestBot/-/tree/master/UTBotCpp/server/src/building/Linker.cpp) writes [Makefiles](/docs/cpp/advanced/makefiles).\n9. [KleeRunner](https://rnd-gitlab-msc.huawei.com/unittestbot/UnitTestBot/-/tree/master/UTBotCpp/server/src/KleeRunner.cpp) runs [KLEE](https://klee.github.io/) on module consecutively for each method from request.\n10. [KleeGenerator](https://rnd-gitlab-msc.huawei.com/unittestbot/UnitTestBot/-/tree/master/UTBotCpp/server/src/KleeGenerator.cpp) parses output of KLEE and writes files of [GoogleTest](https://github.com/google/googletest).\n11. [Server](/docs/cpp/installation/installing-the-utbot-server) sends final response to client and also transfers generated files for remote scenario.\n\n## Tests Running\n\nWhen user runs the tests, server performs various operations that might depend on the compiler used by the project.\n1.

[TestRunner](https://rnd-gitlab-msc.huawei.com/unittestbot/UnitTestBot/-/tree/master/UTBotCpp/server/src/coverage/TestRunner.cpp) collects list of tuples (file path, suite name, test name) based on the information from the [client](/docs/cpp/installation/installing-the-vs-code-plugin).\n4. [TestRunner](https://rnd-gitlab-msc.huawei.com/unittestbot/UnitTestBot/-/tree/master/UTBotCpp/server/src/coverage/TestRunner.cpp) incrementally builds tests with instrumented options (coverage and sanitizer). To achieve this [Makefiles](/docs/cpp/advanced/makefiles) are used.\n5. [TestRunner](https://rnd-gitlab-msc.huawei.com/unittestbot/UnitTestBot/-/tree/master/UTBotCpp/server/src/coverage/TestRunner.cpp) runs tests by calling [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html) on makefiles that correspond to the given sources.\n6. [CoverageAndResultsGenerator](https://rnd-gitlab-msc.huawei.com/unittestbot/UnitTestBot/-/tree/master/UTBotCpp/server/src/coverage/TestRunner.cpp) collects coverage information using previously chosen tool.\n    - [GcovCoverageTool](https://rnd-gitlab-msc.huawei.com/unittestbot/UnitTestBot/-/tree/master/UTBotCpp/server/src/coverage/GcovCoverageTool.cpp) runs [gcov](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Gcov.html) on [.gcno and .gcda](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Gcov-Data-Files.html) files. It provides a report in `.json` format.\n    - [LlvmCoverageTool](https://rnd-gitlab-msc.huawei.com/unittestbot/UnitTestBot/-/tree/master/UTBotCpp/server/src/coverage/LlvmCoverageTool.cpp) runs [llvm-profdata](https://llvm.org/docs/CommandGuide/llvm-profdata.html) to merge several .profraw files into one. \n    It provides a report in `.json` format using [llvm-cov](https://llvm.org/docs/CommandGuide/llvm-cov.html).\n7.  Both [GcovCoverageTool](https://rnd-gitlab-msc.huawei.com/unittestbot/UnitTestBot/-/tree/master/UTBotCpp/server/src/coverage/GcovCoverageTool.cpp) and [LlvmCoverageTool](https://rnd-gitlab-msc.huawei.com/unittestbot/UnitTestBot/-/tree/master/UTBotCpp/server/src/coverage/LlvmCoverageTool.cpp) read  generated `.json` file and determine set of covered lines.\n8.

It is an IDE extension (the client) paired with a docker container with the server application running inside.\n\nThe tool uses symbolic analysis for test cases generation. It is based on the KLEE Symbolic Virtual Machine with a new advanced PDR algorithm being developed by Research Group from Saint Petersburg State University. UnitTestBot incorporates machine learning for test names and test inputs generation. Tests are generated with Google Test Framework macros and can be formatted according to the Huawei Coding Standards.\n\n## Tests Generation\n**UnitTestBot** generates test cases by code, trying to cover maximum statements and execution paths.\nWe treat source code as *source of truth* assuming that behavior is correct (corresponds to initial user demand).\nGenerated tests are placed in the so-called ***regression suite***. Thus, we *fixate* current behavior by test cases.\n\nWhat is the purpose? You obtain **full control** of future code changes. Any code change now **can't break behavior silently**.\nIf developer changes the code, then some tests will fall on CI. Then, ther are two possible scenarios:\n* Initial behavior was <span style=\"color: green\"><b>correct</b></span> but developer <i>broke</i> it. And, as a result, generated test helped to find a bug.\n* Initial behavior was <span style=\"color: red\"><b>incorrect</b></span> and developer <i>fixed</i> it. Then, test must be manually updated to fixate\nnew behavior.\n\nUTBot provides dramatic code quality improvement in the long term: after tests are generated no change can break behavior without an alarm.\n\n## Errors Detection\n\nUnitTestBot is not only able to fixate an existing code, but it also helps to find real bugs in your project.  Some code fragments might be invalid, while developers don't know about it. For example, buffer overflows, assertion failures, segmentation faults, and so on. If UTBot finds an execution\npath leading to such a situation, it creates a special test case that is added to the so-called ***error suite***. \n\n\nWhile all tests from *regression suite* are *green* right after generation, tests from *error suite* are *red* (they fail if you run them).\nSuch tests generated by UnitTestBot are a convenient way to discover critical problems as soon as possible. After developer fixes a bug, tests can be rerun to verify the problem is gone.\n\n## Code Coverage\n\nUTBot tries to generate test cases that:\n* maximize <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_coverage\">code coverage</a> (by statements and branches);\n* minimize number of tests, i.e. if you drop any test case from generated suite, your code coverage decreases.\n\nOf course, in an ideal world we would like to test **every** execution path of the program (so-called *path coverage*), but the number of such\npaths is often infinite due to loops and recursion. UnitTestBot aims to maximize other types of coverages: ***statement coverage***\nand ***branch coverage***, most commonly used in coverage quality assessment tools.\n\n","route":"/docs/cpp"},"9d1e6de5-de1a-59f7-800d-918a18458bbd":{"name":"System Requirements","description":"UnitTestBot requires Visual Studio Code 1.50 or higher and Ubuntu 14.04 or higher to run server on.","content":"\n\n# System Requirements and Supported Systems\n## Client Side\nThe plugin is available for VS Code (1.50+) and its extensions: Huawei VS Code and WeCode. \n\n## Server Side\n**Operating Systems**\n\nLinux : Ubuntu 14, 16, 18, 20, OpenSUSE\n\nWindows : WSL 1, 2 with Ubuntu 14.04+","route":"/docs/cpp/sys-requirements"},"34239caf-3b04-58a2-9aa8-dbc5de5db023":{"name":"UTBot Use Cases","description":"UnitTestBot supports a usage scenarios that assumes working with source code by **SSH** on a remote machine and a scenario with SFTP (or any other equivalent), that transfers files from a remote machine to local.","content":"\nimport WizardGif from '/resources/gifs/wizardInstall.gif';\n\n# UTBot Use Cases\n\nUTBot Server is able to work with sources on the same filesystem. You have two options to comfortably operate with those sources as well:\n* You can use VS Code with UTBot extension locally and synchronize files with files on UTBot server host. For that, we recommend using VS Code [SFTP plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=liximomo.sftp). \n* You can Use VS Code [Remote-SSH](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh) feature to use VS Code with UTBot extension on the same host that runs UTBot server.\n* You can operate UTBot Server via its [Command Line Interface](/docs/cpp/usage/cli).\n\n## Using VS Code extension\n\nLet's suppose you opened your sources folder with VS Code with UTBot extension. It does not matter if that happened on the same host with UTBot Server or on another one.\nIn any case, you will see [UTBot Wizard](/docs/cpp/usage/wizard) which will help you to set up your project for UTBot.\n\nFirstly, it will ask for an IP and port to look for the UTBot Server. You can specify `localhost` if it is the same machine or an IP of the machine that runs UTBot Server.\n\nThen, UTBot Wizard will ask for a path to look for sources, and you should specify a path on the host that runs UTBot Server. If you are on the same machine, then use your path, else use the path of the folder which you sync to.\n\nAfter that, you should specify build folder of your project which contains build artifacts that UTBot uses to generate and build test files. If the project is not build yet, you can try to configure it automatically by clicking notifications that UTBot will send.\n\nAfter you complete the UTBot Wizard, you should be ready to experience UTBot capabilities!\n\n<img src={WizardGif} className=\"demoGif\"/>\n\n## Using Command Line Interface\nThis case is much simpler: you can stop the UTBot Server and invoke it as specified in in [CLI overview](/docs/cpp/usage/cli). You do need to install VS Code extension, as all the work happens in command line.\n\n","route":"/docs/cpp/installation/use-cases"},"e2ee3aa7-c664-570b-8cdc-58f21405e376":{"name":"Installing the VS Code Plugin","description":"A step-by-step instruction to install UnitTestBot extension for Visual Studio Code.","content":"\nimport ClientInstallGif from '/resources/gifs/clientInstall.gif';\n\n#  Installing the VS Code Plugin\n\n## Steps to Install\n\n1.

Depending on the\nstructure of the project, the same file may be related to different targets and be linked with different function\nimplementations. For instance, stubs may or may not be used to link with tests (see [stubs](/docs/cpp/usage/stubs)). For\nease of understanding, UnitTestBot chooses target with stubs in one case and without them in another one, while the\ncode of tests remains the same.\n\n## Start\n\nLet us consider `coreutils` project. When you open the project and go to UTBot Explorer, UTBot Targets view appears at\nthe top. By default, the target with the largest number of files within is chosen. It is `bench-sha224` in that case.\nYou may change that to your preferred target. For example, pick `cat` if you primarily develop `cat` tool.\n\n<img src={TargetsExplorerView} className=\"demoImg\"/>\n\nIt is all right to have many targets in project. However, the default choice may not fit you. Anyway, you may always\njust run test generation and rely on UnitTestBot's hints.\n\n## File is presented in compile/link commands for chosen target, but not included in target's artifact...\n\nLet's see what happens when you run test generation for function `parse_datetime` in `lib\\parse-datetime.c` file with\ndefault target.\n\n<img src={TargetsFileNotPresentedInArtifact} className=\"demoImg\"/>\n\nIt happens very rarely, but it does happen for a reason. Even though current file is presented in compile/link commands\nfor chosen target, it is not included in target's artifact. More specifically, the library `libcoreutils.a` with\nfunction `parse_datetime` is thrown out by linker. So, it doesn't make sense to test particular function as part of\ntarget `bench-sha224`.\n\nLet us see what happens next if you click `Choose target` and choose `date` target instead. Great!

Function could not be a part of target `bench-sha224` in any\ncase, because it is not used by compile and link commands for chosen target.\n\nLet us see what happens next if you click `Choose target` and choose `cat` target instead.

It's required to use one.\nThese subcommands  may require additional options (i.e., `--line-number`) in order to run them. \nExisting options can be displayed via `./utbot generate [SUBCOMMAND] --help`. You can also check them via global `--help-all` option.\n\nGenerated tests can be found in a test folder (`tests` subfolder in the project directory by default).\n\n\n### Examples\nBelow we demonstrate several examples of how to run generation commands.\n\n**Generate tests for snippet**\n\n```sh\nuser@laptop:~$ ./utbot generate --project-path \"/home/snippets/\" snippet --file-path \"home/snippets/snippet.c\"\n```\n\nHere, `--project-path` is path to the parent directory of the given snippet file  `snippet.c`.   \n\n**Generate tests for project**\n```sh\nuser@laptop:~$ ./utbot generate --project-path \"/home/projects/c-project\" project\n```\n\n**Generate tests for function**\n```sh\nuser@laptop:~$ ./utbot generate --project-path \"/home/projects/c-project\" function --file-path /home/projects/c-project/complex_structs.c --line-number 39\n```\n\n**Generate tests with prompted result**\n```sh\nuser@laptop:~$ ./utbot generate --project-path \"/home/projects/c-project/\"  predicate --file-path \"/home/projects/c-project/basic_functions.c\" --line-number 5 --predicate == --return-value 11 --validation-type int32\n```\n\n\n## Run Command\nOne of the main features of UnitTestBot that allows to run tests with coverage is available in CLI mode as well.\nIn order to run the tests, type in the following command: `./utbot run [OPTIONS] [SUBCOMMAND] [SUBCOMMAND OPTIONS]>`. \nSubcommand in this case specifies whether to run all generated tests, tests in one file, or just one specific test.  \n\n```sh\nuser@laptop:~$ ./utbot run --help\nLaunch unit tests and generate coverage info.\nUsage: ./utbot run [OPTIONS] [SUBCOMMAND]\n\nOptions:\n  -h,--help                   Print this help message and exit\n  --help-all                  Expand all help\n[Option Group: Project context]\n  Options:\n    -p,--project-path TEXT REQUIRED\n                                Path to testing project root.\n    -t,--tests-dir TEXT=tests   Relative path to directory in which tests will be generated.\n    -b,--build-dir TEXT=build   Relative path to build directory with compile_commands.json and/or coverage.json.\n[Option Group: Settings context]\n  Options:\n    -g,--generate-for-static    True, if you want UTBot to generate tests for static functions.\n    -v,--verbose                Set if Huawei's five rule standard is required.\n    --timeout INT=30            Maximum time (in seconds) is allowed for generation tests per function.

Consider the following project structure:\n\n```\nexecutable\n|---- lib1.a\n|     |---- A.c\n|     +---- B.c\n|---- lib2.a\n|     |---- C.c\n```\n\nIf we run test generation for `C.c`, all functions from `lib1.a` will be replaced with their stubs on build step. So, if the function `foo` from `C.c` calls the function `bar` from `A.c`, then stub for the function `bar` will be invoked instead. Note that you can still generate tests using the exact definition of `bar`; for that, you will need to unmark `Use Stubs` checkbox in [settings](/docs/cpp/usage/vscode-extension-settings#use-stubs).\n\n### Stub file example\nStub files can be found in `tests/stubs` folder. \nThis is an example of stub file generated for `c-example/lib/dependent_functions.c` from the [example project](https://rnd-gitlab-msc.huawei.com/unittestbot/SampleSolutions/-/tree/master/cpp/c-example):\n```cpp\n// 1624618650000000000\n// Please, do not change the line above\n\n/*\n * This file is automatically generated by UnitTestBot. For further information see http://utbot.inhuawei.com\n * Copyright (c) Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. 2021-2021. All rights reserved.\n */\n\n#ifdef KLEE_MODE\nextern void klee_make_symbolic(void *addr, unsigned long long nbytes, const char *name);\n#endif\n#include \"dependent_functions_stub.h\"\n\n#define NULL ((void*)0)\n\nint double_max_symbolic;\nint double_max(int a, int b) {\n    static int firstTimeCall = 1;\n    #ifdef KLEE_MODE\n        if (firstTimeCall == 1) {\n            firstTimeCall = 0;\n            klee_make_symbolic(&double_max_symbolic, sizeof(double_max_symbolic), \"double_max_symbolic\");\n        }\n    #endif\n    return double_max_symbolic;\n}\n\n```\n\nThe first line contains timestamp of stub file creation. It is required for synchronization with the source code, so, please, do not modify this line:\n```cpp\n// 1619438023000000000\n```\nThen, if a `KLEE_MODE` macro is passed during preprocessing, we add a KLEE declaration to allow us to use symbolic return value. `KLEE_MODE` serves for both test generation and test running purposes.\n```cpp\n#ifdef KLEE_MODE\nextern void klee_make_symbolic(void *addr, unsigned long long nbytes, const char *name);\n#endif\n```\nThis variable stores return value of the stub function:\n```cpp\nint double_max_symbolic;\n```\nStub function signature is always the same as the signature of the source function. If it's not (for example, if the function was modified), then UTBot will synchronize them by rewriting stub function with the new one:\n```cpp\nint double_max(int a, int b)\n```\nIf UTBot uses stubs, then `KLEE_MODE` is defined, and the return value is made symbolic. This way KLEE can decide what values to return to satisfy the execution paths:\n```cpp\nstatic int firstTimeCall = 1;\n#ifdef KLEE_MODE\n    if (firstTimeCall == 1) {\n        firstTimeCall = 0;\n        klee_make_symbolic(&double_max_symbolic, sizeof(double_max_symbolic), \"double_max_symbolic\");\n    }\n#endif\n```\n\n### Stub headers\nFor each stub, a header is generated. It contains definitions of types and structures used in function headers, allowing stubs to be compilable.\nStub headers may contain definitions fetched from system headers and may look obscure, but usually you will not modify them.\n\n> 📝**Note**\n>\n> You can change the stub function body however you want. UTBot saves custom code inside the function while synchronizing. However, if the source function signature changes, then stub function will be completely rewritten.\n\n### Tests with stubs\nFor the tests that use stubs, the return values are generated in a such way that the code coverage is maximized. \nFor example:\n\n```cpp\nextern \"C\" char pointerToPointer_symbolic;\n\nTEST(regression, calc_two_numbers_f_test_1)\n{\n    // Initialize symbolic stubs\n    pointerToPointer_symbolic = '\\x10';\n\n    // Construct input\n    char a = 'c';\n    char b = 'p';\n\n    // Expected output\n    int expected = 2;\n\n    // Trigger the function\n    int actual = calc_two_numbers_f(a, b);\n\n    // Check results\n    EXPECT_EQ(expected, actual);\n}\n\nTEST(regression, calc_two_numbers_f_test_2)\n{\n    // Initialize symbolic stubs\n    pointerToPointer_symbolic = 'b';\n\n    // Construct input\n    char a = 'c';\n    char b = 'b';\n\n    // Expected output\n    int expected = 1;\n\n    // Trigger the function\n    int actual = calc_two_numbers_f(a, b);\n\n    // Check results\n    EXPECT_EQ(expected, actual);\n}\n```\n\nHere `pointerToPointer_symbolic` stores return value for `pointerToPointer` stub function.\n\n### Modifying stubs\n\nAs it was noted, it is easy to rewrite UTBot stubs into anything you want them to be.\nYou should modify only function bodies and not touch header include, or `KLEE_MODE` ifdefs.\nConsider the simplest example:\n```cpp\n// 1624618650000000000\n// Please, do not change the line above\n\n/*\n * This file is automatically generated by UnitTestBot. For further information see http://utbot.inhuawei.com\n * Copyright (c) Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. 2021-2021. All rights reserved.\n */\n\n#ifdef KLEE_MODE\nextern void klee_make_symbolic(void *addr, unsigned long long nbytes, const char *name);\n#endif\n#include \"dependent_functions_stub.h\"\n\n#define NULL ((void*)0)\n\nint double_max_symbolic;\nint double_max(int a, int b) {\n    return a;\n}\n```\n\nIn such a case, UTBot will generate tests for functions from other CMake modules implying that `double_max(int a, int b) = a`.\n\nHowever, you can also use symbolic variable power when modifying stubs. Suppose that you want your function not to return any value, but perform some checks on the arguments prior to that. Also, there may be a special case in that function that is highly important to be reflected in the stub. In that case, you can insert those checks in the stub, and, if they succeed, return a symbolic value:\n```cpp\n// 1624618650000000000\n// Please, do not change the line above\n\n/*\n * This file is automatically generated by UnitTestBot. For further information see http://utbot.inhuawei.com\n * Copyright (c) Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. 2021-2021. All rights reserved.\n */\n\n#ifdef KLEE_MODE\nextern void klee_make_symbolic(void *addr, unsigned long long nbytes, const char *name);\n#endif\n#include \"dependent_functions_stub.h\"\n\n#define NULL ((void*)0)\n\nint double_max_symbolic;\nint double_max(int a, int b) {\n    if (a == 100 && a > b) {\n        return 100;\n    }\n    static int firstTimeCall = 1;\n    #ifdef KLEE_MODE\n        if (firstTimeCall == 1) {\n            firstTimeCall = 0;\n            klee_make_symbolic(&double_max_symbolic, sizeof(double_max_symbolic), \"double_max_symbolic\");\n        }\n    #endif\n    return double_max_symbolic;\n}\n```\n\nBy this change, `double_max(a, b)` will preserve its behaviour if a certain condition holds. This principle can be used to achieve the similarity of the stub and the original code while leaving out big parts of code.","route":"/docs/cpp/usage/stubs"},"1bd2b832-cd4c-5baf-9730-40ef179e1073":{"name":"Statusbar Icons","description":"Before you start working with UnitTestBot, it's worth to pay attention on the IDE's status bar and UTBot-specific controls.","content":"\nimport StatusbarImg from '/resources/images/statusbar.png';\nimport ConnectionOkImg from '/resources/images/connectionOK.png';\nimport ConnectionAlertImg from '/resources/images/connectionALERT.png';\n\n# Statusbar Icons\n\nBefore you start working with UnitTestBot, it's worth to pay attention to the IDE's status bar and UTBot-specific controls there:\n\n<img src={StatusbarImg} className=\"docImg\"/>\n\n\n## Connection Status\nConnection status indicates whether the client and the server are established a connection. \nIf the connection is lost, **OK** (<img src={ConnectionOkImg} style={{display: 'inline-block'}} className=\"docImg\"/>) status changes to **ALERT** (<img src={ConnectionAlertImg} style={{display: 'inline-block'}} className=\"docImg\"/>).\nIn this case you need to check if UTBot container is still running.\n\n## Five Rules\nThis checkbox switches the way generated tests are formatted.

In other words, making a function static limits its scope. Due to this, you can think of a static function as of  \"private\" function in other programming languages. It's commonly believed, that such functions shouldn't be tested, as they are not visible outside and can't be called elsewhere. However, as some projects (e.g. GNU Coreutils) tend to implement the main functionality inside static functions, UnitTestBot gives an opportunity to test them as well. \n\n## Apply Huawei's Five Step Rule Standard\n**Expected value format**: `boolean (checkbox)`;\n\n**Default value**:  `False`;\n\n**JSON identifier**: `unittestbot.testsGeneration.applyHuawei'sFiveStepRuleStandard`.\n\nWhen set to `True` UnitTestBot generates tests in accordance with Huawei's Five Step Rule Standard (verbose formatting), otherwise the tests are generated in a simpler form and take less space (lines of code).\n\n\n## Stubs\n\n#### Implicitly Generate Stubs\n\n**Expected value format**: `boolean (checkbox)`;\n\n**Default value**:  `False`;\n\n**JSON identifier**: `unittestbot.stubs.implicitlyGenerateStubs`.\n\nWhen set to `True`, UTBot will generate stubs for the functions from external modules automatically.\n\nThe function is a part of external module with respect to function (or file) the tests are generated for if it's a part of different linking unit. UTBot detects linking units via link_commands.json.\n\n#### Use Stubs\n\n**Expected value format**: `boolean (checkbox)`;\n\n**Default value**: `False`;\n\n**JSON identifier**: `unittestbot.stubs.useStubs`.\n\nWhen set to `True`, UTBot will use generated stubs from `<testsDir>/stubs` folder instead of real files.\n\n\n\n## Visual\n\n#### Show Test Results\n**Expected value format**: `boolean (checkbox)`;\n\n**Default value**: `True`;\n\n**JSON identifier**: `unittestbot.visual.showTestResults`.\n\nWhen set to `True`, the results of the run tests are displayed on the left side of the test headers.\n\n>✔️ **Recommendation**\n> \n> It's recommended to set given preference to `False` in case you use a separate test runner extension for Visual Studio Code.\n\n## Advanced\n\n#### Enable Developer Mode\n\n**Expected value format**: `boolean (checkbox)`;\n\n**Default value**:  `False`;\n\n**JSON identifier**: `unittestbot.advanced.enableDeveloperMode`.\n\nEnables hidden developer commands useful for debug.\n\n#### Use Deterministic Searcher\n**Expected value format**: `boolean (checkbox)`;\n\n**Default value**:  `False`;\n\n**JSON identifier**: `unittestbot.advanced.useDeterministicSearcher`.\n\nUse deterministic searcher to traverse bitcode in the same way every time. It may significantly slow down tests generation.\n\n#### Timeout Per Function\n**Expected value format**: `number, that represents seconds`;\n\n**Default value**: `30`;\n\n**JSON identifier**: `unittestbot.advanced.timeoutPerFunction`.\n\nMaximum time (in seconds) is allowed for generation tests per function. \nSet to `0` to disable it.\n\n#### Timeout Per Test\n**Expected value format**: `number, that represents seconds`;\n\n**Default value**: `0`;\n\n**JSON identifier**: `unittestbot.advanced.timeoutPerTest`.\n\nMaximum time (in seconds) allowed for a single test being run. After that, the test is automatically cancelled.\nThe option can be used if some of the generated tests force the user code to hang; in such a case, [Run All Tests and Show Coverage](/docs/cpp/usage/run-generated-tests) option will also hang. However, if the timeout for test is specified, hanging tests will be cancelled silently and the coverage will be shown.\nSet to `0` to disable it.","route":"/docs/cpp/usage/vscode-extension-settings"}}}}
