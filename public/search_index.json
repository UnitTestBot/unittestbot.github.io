When necessary makefile is found, use the 'cd' command to move from your present directory to makefile's one.\n3. Run `make -s -f calc.mk run`, for example.\n4. Congratulations!

Depending on the\nstructure of the project, the same file may be related to different targets and be linked with different function\nimplementations. For instance, stubs may or may not be used to link with tests (see [stubs](stubs)). For\nease of understanding, UnitTestBot chooses target with stubs in one case and without them in another one, while the\ncode of tests remains the same.\n\n## Start\n\nLet us consider `coreutils` project. When you open the project and go to UTBot Explorer, UTBot Targets view appears at\nthe top. By default, the target with the largest number of files within is chosen. It is `bench-sha224` in that case.\nYou may change that to your preferred target. For example, pick `cat` if you primarily develop `cat` tool.\n\n![targetsExplorerViewImg](https://github.com/UnitTestBot/unittestbot.github.io/raw/source/resources/images/targetsExplorerView.png)\n\nIt is all right to have many targets in project. However, the default choice may not fit you. Anyway, you may always\njust run test generation and rely on UnitTestBot's hints.\n\n## File is presented in compile/link commands for chosen target, but not included in target's artifact...\n\nLet's see what happens when you run test generation for function `parse_datetime` in `lib\\parse-datetime.c` file with\ndefault target.\n\n![targetsFileNotPresentedInArtifactImg](https://github.com/UnitTestBot/unittestbot.github.io/raw/source/resources/images/targetsFileNotPresentedInArtifact.png)\n\nIt happens very rarely, but it does happen for a reason. Even though current file is presented in compile/link commands\nfor chosen target, it is not included in target's artifact. More specifically, the library `libcoreutils.a` with\nfunction `parse_datetime` is thrown out by linker. So, it doesn't make sense to test particular function as part of\ntarget `bench-sha224`.\n\nLet us see what happens next if you click `Choose target` and choose `date` target instead. Great! Tests were generated\nsuccessfully.\n\n![targetsTestsForDateGeneratedImg](https://github.com/UnitTestBot/unittestbot.github.io/raw/source/resources/images/targetsTestsForDateGenerated.png)\n\n## File is not presented in compile/link commands for chosen target...\n\nLet's see what happens when you run test generation for function `usage` in `src\\cat.c` file with default target.\n\n![targetsFileNotPresentedInCommandsImg](https://github.com/UnitTestBot/unittestbot.github.io/raw/source/resources/images/targetsFileNotPresentedInCommands.png)\n\nIt happens more often, but it also does happen for a reason.

It is an IDE extension (the client) paired with server application.\n\nThe tool uses [symbolic execution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_execution) for test cases generation. UTBot uses KLEE Symbolic Virtual Machine enchanced with a new advanced bidirectional symbolic execution algorithm developed by Research Group from Saint Petersburg State University. Tests are generated in form of [Google Test Framework](https://github.com/google/googletest).\n\n## Tests Generation: Regression Suite\n**UnitTestBot** generates test cases by code, trying to cover maximum statements and execution paths.\nWe treat source code as *source of truth* assuming that behavior is correct (corresponds to initial user demand).\nGenerated tests are placed in the so-called ***regression suite***. Thus, we *fixate* current behavior by test cases.\n\nWhat is the purpose? You obtain **full control** of future code changes. Any code change now **can't break behavior silently**.\nIf developer changes the code, then some tests will fall on CI. Then, ther are two possible scenarios:\n* Initial behavior was <span style=\"color: green\"><b>correct</b></span> but developer <i>broke</i> it. And, as a result, generated test helped to find a bug.\n* Initial behavior was <span style=\"color: red\"><b>incorrect</b></span> and developer <i>fixed</i> it. Then, test must be manually updated to fixate\nnew behavior.\n\nUTBot provides dramatic code quality improvement in the long term: after tests are generated no change can break behavior without an alarm.\n\n## Test Generation: Errors Detection\n\nUnitTestBot is not only able to fixate the behavior in an existing code, but it also helps to find real bugs in your project. Some code fragments might be invalid, while developers don't know about it. For example, buffer overflows, assertion failures, segmentation faults, and so on. If UTBot finds an execution\npath leading to such a situation, it creates a special test case that is added to the so-called ***error suite***. \n\n\nWhile all tests from *regression suite* are *green* right after generation, tests from *error suite* are *red* (they fail if you run them).\nSuch tests generated by UnitTestBot are a convenient way to discover critical problems as soon as possible. After developer fixes a bug, tests can be rerun to verify the problem is gone.\n\n## Code Coverage\n\nUTBot tries to generate test cases that:\n* maximize <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_coverage\">code coverage</a> (by statements and branches);\n* minimize number of tests, i.e. if you drop any test case from generated suite, your code coverage decreases.\n\nOf course, in an ideal world we would like to test **every** execution path of the program (so-called *path coverage*), but the number of such\npaths is often infinite due to loops and recursion. UnitTestBot aims to maximize other types of coverages: ***statement coverage***\nand ***branch coverage***, most commonly used as metrics for coverage quality assessment tools.\n\n","route":"/docs/cpp"},"0b16c61f-047a-5148-8264-fef1c0685ade":{"name":"Step by step","description":"step by step guide how generate tests with UTBotCpp","content":"# Step by step release use\n\n1) #### Install and run server\n    [More about server install](install-server)\n\n    * `(remote only)` Connect to your server \n    * make directory for UTBotCpp \n        `mkdir utbotcpp`\n    * go into directory \n        `cd utbotcpp`\n    * add release version to bash env, check it on [github releases page](https://github.com/UnitTestBot/UTBotCpp/releases)\n        `export UTBOT_VERSION=\"1.0.31\"`\n    * Download archive from \n        `wget https://github.com/UnitTestBot/UTBotCpp/releases/download/v$UTBOT_VERSION/utbot-release-$UTBOT_VERSION.zip`\n    * unarchive zip\n        `unzip utbot-release-$UTBOT_VERSION.zip`\n    * unarchive from tar.gz and run UTBotCpp server\n        `chmod +x unpack_and_run_utbot.sh && ./unpack_and_run_utbot.sh`\n\n    for restart UTBotCpp run `./utbot_server_restart.sh $PORT` from utbot_distr\n\n    ![serverinstallGif](https://github.com/UnitTestBot/unittestbot.github.io/raw/source/resources/gifs/serverInstall.gif)\n\n2) #### `(remote only)` Install VSCode SFTP plugin (skip if you alredy have installed SFTP plugin)\n    * [link](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Natizyskunk.sftp)\n    * in VSCode invoke `Developer: Reload Window`command from the Command pallette `Shift + Ctrl + P` or `F1`\n\n    ![sftpinstallGif](https://github.com/UnitTestBot/unittestbot.github.io/raw/source/resources/gifs/sftpinstall.gif)\n\n3) #### Install VSCode plugin\n    [More about VSCode plugin install](install-vscode-plugin)\n    * `(remote only)` download archive from [github releases page](https://github.com/UnitTestBot/UTBotCpp/releases)\n    * `(remote only)` unarchive zip\n    * in VSCode inovke `Extensions: Install from VSIX` command from the Command pallette `Shift + Ctrl + P` or `F1`\n    * choose the `utbot_plugin.vsix` file, that contains in release zip archive.\n\n    ![clientinstallGif](https://github.com/UnitTestBot/unittestbot.github.io/raw/source/resources/gifs/clientInstall.gif)\n\n4) #### Open project\n    For test project, we recommend use [c-example](https://github.com/UnitTestBot/UTBotCpp/tree/main/integration-tests/c-example)\n    * `File` -> `Open Folder`\n\n5) #### `(remote only)` Add SFTP config\n    * in VSCode invoke `SFTP: config` command from the Command pallette `Shift + Ctrl + P` or `F1`\n    * fill with your data\n    * in VSCode inovke `SFTP: Sync Local -> Remote` command from the Command pallette `Shift + Ctrl + P` or `F1`\n    * check files on server\n\n    ![sftpconfigGif](https://github.com/UnitTestBot/unittestbot.github.io/raw/source/resources/gifs/sftpconfig.gif)\n\n```json \n{\n    \"name\": \"ServerName\",\n    \"host\": \"192.168.1.50\", // your server ip, or host name\n    \"protocol\": \"sftp\",\n    \"port\": 22, // ssh port to server usually 22\n    \"username\": \"utbot\", // username on server\n    \"remotePath\": \"/home/utbot/remote/c-example\", // path for project should same with path that you set in UTBotCpp plugin settings \n    \"uploadOnSave\": true\n}\n``` \n\n6) #### Configure VSCode plugin\n    [More about UTBot wizard](wizard)\n    * in VSCode inovke `Run UTBot: Quickstart Wizard` command from the Command pallette `Shift + Ctrl + P` or `F1`\n    * `Host` on `Connection` page\n        * `(same machine)` set `127.0.0.1` \n        * `(remote only)` set same with SFTP host ip\n    * `Port` on `Connection` page by defult `2121`, or `$PORT` that you use then run `./utbot_server_restart.sh $PORT`\n    * `Remote Path` page\n        * `(same machine)` set path to project that you open\n        * `(remote only)` set same with SFTP remotePath\n    * use defaults`Build Directory` and `CMake Options`\n    * press Finish\n    * Open `UTBot explorer` from left corner or press F1 and type `View: Show UTBot explorer`\n\n    ![wizardGif]( https://github.com/UnitTestBot/unittestbot.github.io/raw/source/resources/gifs/wizard.gif)\n    \n7) #### First tests generation\n    * right click on some source file `Generate Tests` -> `for Current File`\n    * in lower right corner press `Create build folder`\n    * in lower right corner press `Configure`\n\n    ![generateGif]( https://github.com/UnitTestBot/unittestbot.github.io/raw/source/resources/gifs/generate.gif )\n\n8) #### Generate tests\n    [More generate tests](generating-tests)\n    -

Consider the following project structure:\n\n```\nexecutable\n|---- lib1.a\n|     |---- A.c\n|     +---- B.c\n|---- lib2.a\n|     |---- C.c\n```\n\nIf we run test generation for `C.c`, all functions from `lib1.a` will be replaced with their stubs on build step. So, if the function `foo` from `C.c` calls the function `bar` from `A.c`, then stub for the function `bar` will be invoked instead. Note that you can still generate tests using the exact definition of `bar`; for that, you will need to unmark `Use Stubs` checkbox in [settings](vscode-extension-settings#use-stubs).\n\n### Stub file example\nStub files can be found in `tests/stubs` folder. \nThis is an example of stub file generated for `c-example/lib/dependent_functions.c` from the [example project](https://github.com/UnitTestBot/UTBotCpp/tree/main/integration-tests/c-example):\n```cpp\n// 1624618650000000000\n// Please, do not change the line above\n\n/*\n * This file is automatically generated by UnitTestBot. For further information see http://utbot.inhuawei.com\n * Copyright (c) Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. 2021-2021.

It is required for synchronization with the source code, so, please, do not modify this line:\n```cpp\n// 1619438023000000000\n```\nThen, if a `KLEE_MODE` macro is passed during preprocessing, we add a KLEE declaration to allow us to use symbolic return value. `KLEE_MODE` serves for both test generation and test running purposes.\n```cpp\n#ifdef KLEE_MODE\nextern void klee_make_symbolic(void *addr, unsigned long long nbytes, const char *name);\n#endif\n```\nThis variable stores return value of the stub function:\n```cpp\nint double_max_symbolic;\n```\nStub function signature is always the same as the signature of the source function. If it's not (for example, if the function was modified), then UTBot will synchronize them by rewriting stub function with the new one:\n```cpp\nint double_max(int a, int b)\n```\nIf UTBot uses stubs, then `KLEE_MODE` is defined, and the return value is made symbolic. This way KLEE can decide what values to return to satisfy the execution paths:\n```cpp\nstatic int firstTimeCall = 1;\n#ifdef KLEE_MODE\n    if (firstTimeCall == 1) {\n        firstTimeCall = 0;\n        klee_make_symbolic(&double_max_symbolic, sizeof(double_max_symbolic), \"double_max_symbolic\");\n    }\n#endif\n```\n\n### Stub headers\nFor each stub, a header is generated. It contains definitions of types and structures used in function headers, allowing stubs to be compilable.\nStub headers may contain definitions fetched from system headers and may look obscure, but usually you will not modify them.\n\n> 📝**Note**\n>\n> You can change the stub function body however you want. UTBot saves custom code inside the function while synchronizing. However, if the source function signature changes, then stub function will be completely rewritten.\n\n### Tests with stubs\nFor the tests that use stubs, the return values are generated in a such way that the code coverage is maximized. \nFor example:\n\n```cpp\nextern \"C\" char pointerToPointer_symbolic;\n\nTEST(regression, calc_two_numbers_f_test_1)\n{\n    // Initialize symbolic stubs\n    pointerToPointer_symbolic = '\\x10';\n\n    // Construct input\n    char a = 'c';\n    char b = 'p';\n\n    // Expected output\n    int expected = 2;\n\n    // Trigger the function\n    int actual = calc_two_numbers_f(a, b);\n\n    // Check results\n    EXPECT_EQ(expected, actual);\n}\n\nTEST(regression, calc_two_numbers_f_test_2)\n{\n    // Initialize symbolic stubs\n    pointerToPointer_symbolic = 'b';\n\n    // Construct input\n    char a = 'c';\n    char b = 'b';\n\n    // Expected output\n    int expected = 1;\n\n    // Trigger the function\n    int actual = calc_two_numbers_f(a, b);\n\n    // Check results\n    EXPECT_EQ(expected, actual);\n}\n```\n\nHere `pointerToPointer_symbolic` stores return value for `pointerToPointer` stub function.\n\n### Modifying stubs\n\nAs it was noted, it is easy to rewrite UTBot stubs into anything you want them to be.\nYou should modify only function bodies and not touch header include, or `KLEE_MODE` ifdefs.\nConsider the simplest example:\n\n```cpp\n// 1624618650000000000\n// Please, do not change the line above\n\n/*\n * This file is automatically generated by UnitTestBot. For further information see http://utbot.inhuawei.com\n * Copyright (c) Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. 2021-2021. All rights reserved.\n */\n\n#ifdef KLEE_MODE\nextern void klee_make_symbolic(void *addr, unsigned long long nbytes, const char *name);\n#endif\n#include \"dependent_functions_stub.h\"\n\n#define NULL ((void*)0)\n\nint double_max_symbolic;\nint double_max(int a, int b) {\n    return a;\n}\n```\n\nIn such a case, UTBot will generate tests for functions from other CMake modules implying that `double_max(int a, int b) = a`.\n\nHowever, you can also use symbolic variable power when modifying stubs. Suppose that you want your function not to return any value, but perform some checks on the arguments prior to that. Also, there may be a special case in that function that is highly important to be reflected in the stub. In that case, you can insert those checks in the stub, and, if they succeed, return a symbolic value:\n\n```cpp\n// 1624618650000000000\n// Please, do not change the line above\n\n/*\n * This file is automatically generated by UnitTestBot. For further information see http://utbot.inhuawei.com\n * Copyright (c) Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. 2021-2021. All rights reserved.\n */\n\n#ifdef KLEE_MODE\nextern void klee_make_symbolic(void *addr, unsigned long long nbytes, const char *name);\n#endif\n#include \"dependent_functions_stub.h\"\n\n#define NULL ((void*)0)\n\nint double_max_symbolic;\nint double_max(int a, int b) {\n    if (a == 100 && a > b) {\n        return 100;\n    }\n    static int firstTimeCall = 1;\n    #ifdef KLEE_MODE\n        if (firstTimeCall == 1) {\n            firstTimeCall = 0;\n            klee_make_symbolic(&double_max_symbolic, sizeof(double_max_symbolic), \"double_max_symbolic\");\n        }\n    #endif\n    return double_max_symbolic;\n}\n```\n\nBy this change, `double_max(a, b)` will preserve its behaviour if a certain condition holds. This principle can be used to achieve the similarity of the stub and the original code while leaving out big parts of code.","route":"/docs/cpp/usage/stubs"},"77c486c2-fbdf-5401-8575-5f8f8bd882d9":{"name":"UTBot Use Cases","description":"UnitTestBot supports a usage scenarios that assumes working with source code by **SSH** on a remote machine and a scenario with SFTP (or any other equivalent), that transfers files from a remote machine to local.","content":"\n# UTBot Use Cases\n\nUTBot Server is able to work with sources on the same filesystem. You have two options to comfortably operate with those sources as well:\n* You can use VS Code with UTBot extension locally and synchronize files with files on UTBot server host. For that, we recommend using VS Code [SFTP plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=liximomo.sftp). \n* You can Use VS Code [Remote-SSH](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh) feature to use VS Code with UTBot extension on the same host that runs UTBot server.\n* You can operate UTBot Server via its [Command Line Interface](command-line-interface).\n\n## Using VS Code extension\n\nLet's suppose you opened your sources folder with VS Code with UTBot extension. It does not matter if that happened on the same host with UTBot Server or on another one.\nIn any case, you will see [UTBot Wizard](wizard) which will help you to set up your project for UTBot.\n\nFirstly, it will ask for an IP and port to look for the UTBot Server. You can specify `localhost` if it is the same machine or an IP of the machine that runs UTBot Server.\n\nThen, UTBot Wizard will ask for a path to look for sources, and you should specify a path on the host that runs UTBot Server. If you are on the same machine, then use your path, else use the path of the folder which you sync to.\n\nAfter that, you should specify build folder of your project which contains build artifacts that UTBot uses to generate and build test files. If the project is not build yet, you can try to configure it automatically by clicking notifications that UTBot will send.\n\nAfter you complete the UTBot Wizard, you should be ready to experience UTBot capabilities!\n\n![wizardInstallGif](https://github.com/UnitTestBot/unittestbot.github.io/raw/source/resources/gifs/wizardInstall.gif)\n\n## Using Command Line Interface\nThis case is much simpler: you can stop the UTBot Server and invoke it as specified in in [CLI overview](command-line-interface).

**STDIN_FILENO**. UTBot marks read values as symbolic, generates tests, puts the needed data into a C-string buffer and redirects **stdin** to the buffer so tests can be executed properly.\n\nHere is an example of a

in this section. It gives a basic overview of the product inside that might be useful for the ones who would like to contribute to UnitTestBot.","content":"\n# How UTBot Works\n\n\n## Tests Generation\nThe pipeline of tests generation is too long and straightforward. The most important things are described below in sequential order.\n\n1. [Client](install-vscode-plugin) sends request (one of [types](generating-tests)) \nto [server](install-server). \nThe [corresponding](https://github.com/UnitTestBot/UTBotCpp/tree/main/server/src/testgens) object aggregates requests' information.\n2. [Fetcher](https://github.com/UnitTestBot/UTBotCpp/blob/main/server/src/fetchers/Fetcher.cpp) fetches types, methods, global variable usages, array usages, includes for all files in request. \nIt uses [LibTooling](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/LibTooling.html) for parsing source code, traversing types, etc.\n3. [SourceToHeaderRewriter](https://github.com/UnitTestBot/UTBotCpp/tree/main/server/src/clang-utils/SourceToHeaderRewriter.cpp) generates headers (.h files) based on source (.c files).\n4. [FeaturesFilter](https://github.com/UnitTestBot/UTBotCpp/tree/main/server/src/FeaturesFilter.cpp) filters out all methods except the ones listed in [supported syntax](c-syntax).\n5. [Synchronizer](https://github.com/UnitTestBot/UTBotCpp/tree/main/server/src/Synchronizer.cpp) synchronizes [stubs](stubs) and wrappers for all files in [compile_commands.json](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/JSONCompilationDatabase.html).\n6. [KleeGenerator](https://github.com/UnitTestBot/UTBotCpp/tree/main/server/src/KleeGenerator.cpp) generates klee files as well as source files, also builds them in [bitcode](https://llvm.org/docs/BitCodeFormat.html) files.\n7. [Linker](https://github.com/UnitTestBot/UTBotCpp/tree/main/server/src/building/Linker.cpp) links bitcode files together into module.\n8. [Linker](https://github.com/UnitTestBot/UTBotCpp/tree/main/server/src/building/Linker.cpp) writes [Makefiles](makefiles).\n9. [KleeRunner](https://github.com/UnitTestBot/UTBotCpp/tree/main/server/src/KleeRunner.cpp) runs [KLEE](https://klee.github.io/) on module consecutively for each method from request.\n10. [KleeGenerator](https://github.com/UnitTestBot/UTBotCpp/tree/main/server/src/KleeGenerator.cpp) parses output of KLEE and writes files of [GoogleTest](https://github.com/google/googletest).\n11. [Server](install-server) sends final response to client and also transfers generated files for remote scenario.\n\n## Tests Running\n\nWhen user runs the tests, server performs various operations that might depend on the compiler used by the project.\n1. [Client](install-vscode-plugin) sends request to [server](install-server).\n2. [TestRunner](https://github.com/UnitTestBot/UTBotCpp/tree/main/server/src/coverage/TestRunner.cpp) chooses coverage tool based on the compiler used by the project. \nIt is [GcovCoverageTool](https://github.com/UnitTestBot/UTBotCpp/tree/main/server/src/coverage/GcovCoverageTool.cpp) in case of [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/) and [LlvmCoverageTool](https://github.com/UnitTestBot/UTBotCpp/tree/main/server/src/coverage/LlvmCoverageTool.cpp)  in case of [clang](https://clang.llvm.org/).\n3. [TestRunner](https://github.com/UnitTestBot/UTBotCpp/tree/main/server/src/coverage/TestRunner.cpp) collects list of tuples (file path, suite name, test name) based on the information from the [client](install-vscode-plugin).\n4. [TestRunner](https://github.com/UnitTestBot/UTBotCpp/tree/main/server/src/coverage/TestRunner.cpp) incrementally builds tests with instrumented options (coverage and sanitizer). To achieve this [Makefiles](makefiles) are used.\n5. [TestRunner](https://github.com/UnitTestBot/UTBotCpp/tree/main/server/src/coverage/TestRunner.cpp) runs tests by calling [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html) on makefiles that correspond to the given sources.\n6. [CoverageAndResultsGenerator](https://github.com/UnitTestBot/UTBotCpp/blob/main/server/src/coverage/CoverageAndResultsGenerator.cpp) collects coverage information using previously chosen tool.\n    - [GcovCoverageTool](https://github.com/UnitTestBot/UTBotCpp/tree/main/server/src/coverage/GcovCoverageTool.cpp) runs [gcov](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Gcov.html) on [.gcno and .gcda](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Gcov-Data-Files.html) files. It provides a report in `.json` format.\n    - [LlvmCoverageTool](https://github.com/UnitTestBot/UTBotCpp/tree/main/server/src/coverage/LlvmCoverageTool.cpp) runs [llvm-profdata](https://llvm.org/docs/CommandGuide/llvm-profdata.html) to merge several .profraw files into one. \n    It provides a report in `.json` format using [llvm-cov](https://llvm.org/docs/CommandGuide/llvm-cov.html).\n7.  Both [GcovCoverageTool](https://github.com/UnitTestBot/UTBotCpp/tree/main/server/src/coverage/GcovCoverageTool.cpp) and [LlvmCoverageTool](https://github.com/UnitTestBot/UTBotCpp/tree/main/server/src/coverage/LlvmCoverageTool.cpp) read  generated `.json` file and determine set of covered lines.\n8. Finally, [Server](install-server) sends response to the client.\n","route":"/docs/cpp/advanced/utbot-inside"},"b6eb4443-aca7-5146-a7ef-2bd53764a855":{"name":"Installing and Setting Up the UTBot Server","description":"A step-by-step instruction to install and run the UTBot Server on a Linux host.","content":"\n# Installing and Setting Up the UTBot Server\n\nThis page provides a step-by-step instruction to install and run the **UTBot Server** on a Linux host. For list of supported platforms, see [system requirements](system-requirements).\n\nYou probably would want to install [UTBot VS Code Plugin](install-vscode-plugin) after you finish server instalation.\n\n## Steps to Install\n\n1. Place [release](https://github.com/UnitTestBot/UTBotCpp/releases) zip archive in your working directory.\n\n2. Unzip archive\n\n3. Run the script:\n\n```sh\n$ chmod +x unpack_and_run_utbot.sh && ./unpack_and_run_utbot.sh\n```\n\n3. The script will unpack required dependencies in a folder and then run server executable. You will be given information about its process id, logging path, path to temporary artifacts and port (the default option is `2121`). At any time you can kill the server using `kill $pid`. If you want to launch UTBot server on another port, you can enter the directory `utbot_distr` and call the script \n```sh\n$ ./utbot_server_restart.sh $PORT\n````\n   \n## Installation Demo\nThe animation below demonstrates the deploying process for the UTBot Server and mounting a simple C project inside it.\n\n![serverInstallGif](https://github.com/UnitTestBot/unittestbot.github.io/raw/source/resources/gifs/serverInstall.gif)","route":"/docs/cpp/installation/installing-the-utbot-server"},"39d77b6c-94ef-518a-9d0a-9cb8c3d57c09":{"name":"System Requirements","description":"UnitTestBot requires Visual Studio Code 1.50 or higher and Ubuntu 18.04 or higher to run server on.","content":"\n# System Requirements and Supported Systems\n## Client Side\nThe plugin is available for VS Code (1.50+)\n\n## Server Side\n**Operating Systems**\n\nLinux : Ubuntu 18.04, 20.04\n\nWindows : WSL 1, 2 with Ubuntu 18.04+","route":"/docs/cpp/sys-requirements"},"f11a7ed0-f964-5fc5-b233-d4f94f1a78ec":{"name":"UTBot Logging Principles","description":"UTBot writes logs for most of the operations it executes. The server generates logs and temporary files while tests generation. Client logs monitor requests sent to server and received responses.","content":"\n# UTBot logging principles\n\n## Server log\nThe server generates two types of data: logs and temporary files needed to generate tests. Log data is written into `logs` folder placed inside the docker container. The path in which folder is created can be managed by passing `--log /my/path` option to UnitTestBot binary. The default path for this option is the home folder: `/home/{$USERNAME}/logs`.\n\nThe same principles are applied to the temporary directory `tmp`, in which the artifacts are placed and which path you can control via `--tmp /my/path` option.\n\nThe `logs` folder structure is represented in the following way:\n\n* logs\n    * client1\n        * everything.log\n        * latest_readable.log\n        * project1\n            * stage1\n                * timestamp.log\n            * stage2\n                * timestamp.log\n        * project2\n    * client2\n    * everything.log\n    * latest_readable.log\n\nAs you can see, the server creates a subdirectory for each client. There are two files inside it: one of them stores every log message written during the execution of the requests from this client, while the other stores **INFO** level logs from the last session. There are **ERROR**, **WARNING**, **INFO** and **DEBUG** logging levels.\n\nBesides writing server log to files, UTBot sends the same logs to clients so they can be viewed in VS Code directly. You can find them in a tab called **UTBot: Server Log**.\n\n![utbotServerLogImg](https://github.com/UnitTestBot/unittestbot.github.io/raw/source/resources/images/utbotServerLog.png)\n\nLogging level can be changed using the **UTBot: Log Settings** menu item.\n\n![logLevelGif](https://github.com/UnitTestBot/unittestbot.github.io/raw/source/resources/gifs/logLevel.gif)\n\n## Client logs\n\nClient logs monitors sent requests and received responses.

It may significantly slow down generation.\n    --no-stubs                  True, if you don’t want UTBot to use generated stubs from <testsDir>/stubs folder instead real files.\n\nSubcommands:\n  project                     Generate tests for C project.\n  stubs                       Generate stubs for project.\n  folder                      Generate tests for folder.\n  file                        Generate tests for file in project.\n  snippet                     Generate tests for code snippet.\n  function                    Generate tests for function.\n  class                       Generate tests for C++ class.\n  line                        Generate tests for line in file.\n  assertion                   Generate tests that fails assertion.\n  predicate                   Generate tests with given result.\n```\n\nThe command provides other subcommands, that specify test generation mode. It's required to use one.\nThese subcommands  may require additional options (i.e., `--line-number`) in order to run them. \nExisting options can be displayed via `./utbot generate [SUBCOMMAND] --help`. You can also check them via global `--help-all` option.\n\nGenerated tests can be found in a test folder (`tests` subfolder in the project directory by default).\n\n\n### Examples\nBelow we demonstrate several examples of how to run generation commands.\n\n**Generate tests for snippet**\n\n```sh\nuser@laptop:~$ ./utbot generate --project-path \"/home/snippets/\" snippet --file-path \"home/snippets/snippet.c\"\n```\n\nHere, `--project-path` is path to the parent directory of the given snippet file  `snippet.c`.   \n\n**Generate tests for project**\n```sh\nuser@laptop:~$ ./utbot generate --project-path \"/home/projects/c-project\" project\n```\n\n**Generate tests for function**\n```sh\nuser@laptop:~$ ./utbot generate --project-path \"/home/projects/c-project\" function --file-path /home/projects/c-project/complex_structs.c --line-number 39\n```\n\n**Generate tests with prompted result**\n```sh\nuser@laptop:~$ ./utbot generate --project-path \"/home/projects/c-project/\"  predicate --file-path \"/home/projects/c-project/basic_functions.c\" --line-number 5 --predicate == --return-value 11 --validation-type int32\n```\n\n\n## Run Command\nOne of the main features of UnitTestBot that allows to run tests with coverage is available in CLI mode as well.\nIn order to run the tests, type in the following command: `./utbot run [OPTIONS] [SUBCOMMAND] [SUBCOMMAND OPTIONS]>`. \nSubcommand in this case specifies whether to run all generated tests, tests in one file, or just one specific test.  \n\n```sh\nuser@laptop:~$ ./utbot run --help\nLaunch unit tests and generate coverage info.\nUsage: ./utbot run [OPTIONS] [SUBCOMMAND]\n\nOptions:\n  -h,--help                   Print this help message and exit\n  --help-all                  Expand all help\n[Option Group: Project context]\n  Options:\n    -p,--project-path TEXT REQUIRED\n                                Path to testing project root.\n    -t,--tests-dir TEXT=tests   Relative path to directory in which tests will be generated.\n    -b,--build-dir TEXT=build   Relative path to build directory with compile_commands.json and/or coverage.json.\n[Option Group: Settings context]\n  Options:\n    -g,--generate-for-static    True, if you want UTBot to generate tests for static functions.\n    -v,--verbose                Set if Huawei’s five rule standard is required.\n    --timeout INT=30            Maximum time (in seconds) is allowed for generation tests per function. Set to non-positive number to disable it.\n    --no-deterministic-searcher Use deterministic searcher to traverse bitcode in the same way every time. It may significantly slow down generation.\n    --no-stubs                  True, if you don’t want UTBot to use generated stubs from <testsDir>/stubs folder instead real files.\n\nSubcommands:\n  test                        Run specified test\n  file                        Run all tests in specified file\n  project                     Run all tests for this project\n```\nSimiliarly to `generate` subcommands, you can access manual for `run` subcommands via `./utbot run [SUBCOMMAND] --help`.\n\n### Examples\n\n**Run all tests for project**\n\n```sh\nuser@laptop:~$ ./utbot run --project-path \"/home/projects/c-project\" project\n```\n\n**Run test file**\n\n```sh\nuser@laptop:~$ ./utbot run --project-path \"/home/projects/c-project\" file --file-path \"home/projects/c-project/tests/basic_functions_test.cpp\"  \n```\n\n**Run specific test**\n```sh\nuser@laptop:~$ ./utbot run --project-path \"/home/projects/c-project\" test --file-path \"/home/projects/c-project/tests/basic_functions_test.cpp\" --test-suite \"regression\" --test-name \"max__test_1\"\n```\n\n## All Command\n\nFor simplicity, UTBot CLI provides `all` command, that firstly generates stubs for the project, then generates project tests and finally runs them with coverage.\n\n```sh\nuser@laptop:~$ ./utbot all --help\nSequential launch of 'generate stubs' -> 'generate project' -> 'run'.\nUsage: ./utbot all [OPTIONS]\n\nOptions:\n  -h,--help                   Print this help message and exit\n  --help-all                  Expand all help\n  --no-coverage BOOLEAN       Flag that controls coverage generation.\n  -s,--src-paths TEXT         Relative paths to directories, containing source files.

Right mouse click on VS Code Explorer;\n2. Select `UTBot: Generate Tests for Project`.\n\n![projectGif](https://github.com/UnitTestBot/unittestbot.github.io/raw/source/resources/gifs/project.gif)\n\n>📝**Note**\n>\n> It can take some time to analyze a big project. If you see a pop-up message at the right bottom corner of the IDE window, it means analysis is still in progress.\n> Once code analysis is completed, a test folder will be created.\n\n## Generating Tests for Folder\n\nYou can generate tests for the folder.\n\n**How-to steps**:\n1. Right mouse click on VS Code Explorer;\n2. Select `UTBot: Generate Tests for Folder`;\n3. Specify the path to the folder you want to generate tests for.\n\n![folderGif](https://github.com/UnitTestBot/unittestbot.github.io/raw/source/resources/gifs/folder.gif)\n\n## Generating Tests for File\n\nYou can generate tests for a `'*.c'` file.\n\n>📝**Note**\n>\n> It's worth to note only public functions (declared in a corresponding header file) are considered as targets for tests.\n\n**How-to steps**:\n1. Right mouse click to a target source file;\n2. Select `UTBot: Generate Tests... for Current File`.\n\n![file.Gif](https://github.com/UnitTestBot/unittestbot.github.io/raw/source/resources/gifs/file.gif)\n\nOnce code analysis is completed, a test folder with test named according convention `test_%filename%.cpp` will be created.\nNow you can sync local and remote environments, recompile the project and run tests.\n\n## Generating Tests for Function\n\nGenerate tests for a particular function is also possible.\n\n**How-to steps**:\n1. Move the caret inside function body;\n2. Right mouse click to a text editor;\n3. Select `UTBot: Generate Tests... > for Current Function`.\n\n![functionGif](https://github.com/UnitTestBot/unittestbot.github.io/raw/source/resources/gifs/function.gif)\n\nOnce code analysis is completed, a test folder with test named according convention `test_%filename%.cpp` will be created.\nNow you can sync local and remote environments, recompile the project and run tests.\n\n## Generating Tests for Line\n\nIt's even possible to cover a particular branch instead of entire function.\n\n**How-to steps**:\n1. Move the caret to a line you're going to cover by a test;\n2. Right mouse click to a text editor;\n3. Select `UTBot: Generate Tests... > for Current Line`.\n\n![lineGif](https://github.com/UnitTestBot/unittestbot.github.io/raw/source/resources/gifs/line.gif)\n\nOnce code analysis is completed, a test folder with a test file named according convention `test_%filename%.cpp` will be created.\nNow you can sync local and remote environments, recompile the project and the run test.\n\n## Generating Tests with Prompted Result\n\nIf you need to find parameters for which a function returns a specific output, you may find this UTBot feature extremely useful. \n\n>📝**Note**\n>\n> In general, UTBot **is not able to solve NP-hard problems**, that's why it is meaningless to use this feature on, for example, hash functions.\n\n**How-to steps**:\n1. Move the caret inside a function body;\n2. Right mouse click to a text editor;\n3. Select `UTBot: Generate Tests... > with a Prompted Result`.\n\n![resultGif](https://github.com/UnitTestBot/unittestbot.github.io/raw/source/resources/gifs/result.gif)\n\nSet up a condition (as an inequation or as an equation) the target output satisfies:\nan operator (in C syntax),\na value (constants supported only).\n\n## Generating Tests that Fail Assertion\nIf some code blocks in your project are guarded by asserts (means, classic C-language asserts provided by \"assert.h\") you probably want to know which parameters break them. With UnitTestBot you can generate tests to find such parameters.\n\n**How-to steps**:\n1. Move the caret to a line with `assert(...)` statement you're going to break;\n2. Right mouse click to a text editor;\n3.

Learn more about UTBot Server installation. \n\n**Expected value format**: `number, that represents a port`;\n\n**Default value**: `2121`;\n\n**JSON identifier**: `unittestbot.deployment.utbotPort`.\n\nThe port used by the client to connect to UTBot Server via a gRPC channel. \nThis field should be filled accordingly to the UTBot Server Port parameter specified during the UTBot Server installation.\n\n\n#### Remote Path\n\n**Expected value format**: `UNIX path`;\n\n**Default value**: `<empty string>`;\n\n**JSON identifier**: `unittestbot.deployment.remotePath`.\n\nRemote path configuration specifies the path to the project on a remote host.\n\nWhen VSCode Remote Scenario is used, Remote Path matches the workspace path and it can be automatically determined by UnitTestBot extension.\nIn case you work via SFTP scenario (or any equivalent) Remote Path should be set manually and correspond to the location of the project on a remote host.\n\n\n\n## Paths\n\n#### Build Directory\n**Expected value format**: `UNIX path`;\n\n**Default value**: `build`;\n\n**JSON identifier**: `unittestbot.paths.buildDirectory`.\n\nRelative path to the build directory. File `compile_commands.json` (as well as link_commands.json) should be located in the build folder. \n\n#### CMake options\n**Expected value format**: `string, that represents valid CMake flags`;\n\n**Default value**: `-DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON -DCMAKE_EXPORT_LINK_COMMANDS=ON`;\n\n**JSON identifier**: `unittestbot.paths.cmakeOptions.description`.\n\nOptions passed to CMake command when auto build your project first time you open it.\n\n#### Source Directories\n**Expected value format**: `UNIX paths, separated by commas`;\n\n**Default value**: `<empty>`;\n\n**JSON identifier**: `unittestbot.paths.sourceDirectories`.\n\nRelative paths to the directories, that are marked as source directories. UTBot looks for source file in specified directories.\n\n>📝**Note**\n>\n> Please, prefer using UTBot Explorer View instead of raw settings. UTBot Explorer View makes it possible to mark/unmark directories as \"source directories\".\n\n#### Tests Directory\n\n**Expected value format**: `UNIX path`;\n\n**Default value**: `tests`;\n\n**JSON identifier**: `unittestbot.paths.testsDirectory`.\n\nRelative path to the directory where generated tests will be placed.\n\n\n## Tests Generation\n\n#### Generate for Static Functions\n\n**Expected value format**: `boolean (checkbox)`;\n\n**Default value**: `True`;\n\n**JSON identifier**: `unittestbot.testsGeneration.generateForStaticFunctions`.\n\nWhen set to `True`, UnitTestBot generates tests for C static functions, otherwise such functions won't be proceeded. \n\n> 📝**Note**\n>\n> In C, a static function is not visible outside of its translation unit, which is the object file it is compiled into. In other words, making a function static limits its scope. Due to this, you can think of a static function as of  \"private\" function in other programming languages. It's commonly believed, that such functions shouldn't be tested, as they are not visible outside and can't be called elsewhere. However, as some projects (e.g. GNU Coreutils) tend to implement the main functionality inside static functions, UnitTestBot gives an opportunity to test them as well. \n\n## Apply Huawei's Five Step Rule Standard\n**Expected value format**: `boolean (checkbox)`;\n\n**Default value**:  `False`;\n\n**JSON identifier**: `unittestbot.testsGeneration.applyHuawei'sFiveStepRuleStandard`.\n\nWhen set to `True` UnitTestBot generates tests in accordance with Huawei's Five Step Rule Standard (verbose formatting), otherwise the tests are generated in a simpler form and take less space (lines of code).\n\n\n## Stubs\n\n#### Implicitly Generate Stubs\n\n**Expected value format**: `boolean (checkbox)`;\n\n**Default value**:  `False`;\n\n**JSON identifier**: `unittestbot.stubs.implicitlyGenerateStubs`.\n\nWhen set to `True`, UTBot will generate stubs for the functions from external modules automatically.\n\nThe function is a part of external module with respect to function (or file) the tests are generated for if it's a part of different linking unit. UTBot detects linking units via link_commands.json.\n\n#### Use Stubs\n\n**Expected value format**: `boolean (checkbox)`;\n\n**Default value**: `False`;\n\n**JSON identifier**: `unittestbot.stubs.useStubs`.\n\nWhen set to `True`, UTBot will use generated stubs from `<testsDir>/stubs` folder instead of real files.\n\n\n\n## Visual\n\n#### Show Test Results\n**Expected value format**: `boolean (checkbox)`;\n\n**Default value**: `True`;\n\n**JSON identifier**: `unittestbot.visual.showTestResults`.\n\nWhen set to `True`, the results of the run tests are displayed on the left side of the test headers.\n\n>✔️ **Recommendation**\n> \n> It's recommended to set given preference to `False` in case you use a separate test runner extension for Visual Studio Code.\n\n## Advanced\n\n#### Enable Developer Mode\n\n**Expected value format**: `boolean (checkbox)`;\n\n**Default value**:  `False`;\n\n**JSON identifier**: `unittestbot.advanced.enableDeveloperMode`.\n\nEnables hidden developer commands useful for debug.\n\n#### Use Deterministic Searcher\n**Expected value format**: `boolean (checkbox)`;\n\n**Default value**:  `False`;\n\n**JSON identifier**: `unittestbot.advanced.useDeterministicSearcher`.\n\nUse deterministic searcher to traverse bitcode in the same way every time. It may significantly slow down tests generation.\n\n#### Timeout Per Function\n**Expected value format**: `number, that represents seconds`;\n\n**Default value**: `30`;\n\n**JSON identifier**: `unittestbot.advanced.timeoutPerFunction`.\n\nMaximum time (in seconds) is allowed for generation tests per function. \nSet to `0` to disable it.\n\n#### Timeout Per Test\n**Expected value format**: `number, that represents seconds`;\n\n**Default value**: `0`;\n\n**JSON identifier**: `unittestbot.advanced.timeoutPerTest`.\n\nMaximum time (in seconds) allowed for a single test being run.

Install docker for [Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) or [WSL+Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/wsl/)\n2. Install docker plugin that allows to mount host filesystem and remap owner and group:  \n   ```\n   docker plugin install lebokus/bindfs\n   ```\n3. Login into github docker registry: \n   ```\n   docker login -u <github-username> -p <github-personal-access-token> ghcr.io\n   ``` \n   > You can create new `<personal-access-token>` on [this github page](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new). Don't forget to check `read:packages` permission.   \n   > More details are described [here](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry#authenticating-to-the-container-registry).\n   \n4. Run `docker/utbot_docker_dev.sh` [script](https://github.com/UnitTestBot/UTBotCpp/blob/main/docker/utbot_docker_dev.sh). It will unpack the docker image and mount UTBot sources inside it.\n   UTBot binary can be built in the docker and run in it.\n   The script will prompt you to enter docker image tag. You can find the most recent tag [here](https://github.com/UnitTestBot/UTBotCpp/pkgs/container/utbotcpp%2Fbase_env), for example `24-11-2021`. \n   \n   Installer will ask about `ssh_port` on host machine. This port will be forwarded inside container's ssh port (by default `sshd` in container listens 2020). \n   You may then login inside docker via `ssh utbot@host -p $ssh_port`, where `host` is a host machine IP address.\n   > ⚠ Specify free port that is not in use on host machine!\n    \n   Also, you will be prompted to enter a gRPC port on host machine that will be forwarded inside container's 2121 port where UTBot listens gRPC requests.   \n   > Script will run docker image, mount specified folder on host filesystem into container's filesystem and forward ports for ssh and gRPC.\n\n\n5. Login via ssh into newly started container\n   ``` \n   ssh utbot@host -p $ssh_port \n   ``` \n   > You can type `localhost` as `host` if you are inside terminal of a host machine)\n   > If you are prompted a password, enter `utbot`.\n\n6. Clone UTBotCpp repository into home directory **inside docker container**, preferably with ssh.\n7. `cd` into `UTBotCpp` directory and run `build.sh` — it is the script that builds KLEE UTBot and runs UTBot unit tests\n8. Clone submodules `git submodule update --init --recursive`\n9. Navigate to `UTBotCpp/server/build` directory and launch the binary with `./utbot server` command. Now the server is running.\n10. Launch VS Code on your local machine. Use VS Code [Remote-SSH](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh) to get access to the docker insides. Navigate to `UTBotCpp/vscode-plugin` directory and run `build.sh` script.\n11. Press F5 (*Run Extension*). This will run UTBot VS Code plugin.\n12. A new VS Code window will open; this window will have UTBot VS Code plugin enabled. In this new folder, open `UTBotCpp/integration-tests/c-example` directory.\n13. When UTBot Quickstart Wizard requests you to enter server host and port, specify `localhost` and UTBot server run port 2121, respectively.\n   ![Oops, something went wrong! Please look at wizardInstall.gif](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UnitTestBot/unittestbot.github.io/source/resources/gifs/wizardInstall.gif \"UTBot Wizard Demo\")\n14. Select project path as `/home/utbot/UTBotCpp/integration-tests/c-example`;\n15. You are now ready to experience UTBot capabilities! You can view possible commands in Command Palette (Press F1 and type in UTBot).\n\nIf you want to change UTBot test generation preferences, you can edit them in  File > Preferences > Settings > Extensions > UnitTestBot.\nAfter UTBot configuration, you can select your source directories with the tab on the VSCode toolbar on the left. Then, you can generate tests with the use of Command Palette. Press **F1** and type in \"UTBot\": You will see tests generation options.\n\n## How to develop UTBotCpp with an CLion\n\nYou can edit UTBot sources, rebuild and rerun the server.\n\nTo setup it:\n1. Open UTBotCpp project in CLion on your local machine.\n2. Open **Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > Toolchains**.\n3. Add a new *Remote Host* toolchain.\n4. In *Credentials* section, set up an `ssh` connection to the UTBot docker container you have. Consider enabling connection via OpehSSH authentification agent to ease files synchronization.\n6. All other fields should fill in automatically.\n","route":"/docs/cpp/develop/build"}}}}
