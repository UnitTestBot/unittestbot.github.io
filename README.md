# What is UTBot Cloud?

UTBot Cloud is a web application allowing:
* Generate and run tests for a file written in C language with the corresponding report
* Generate and run tests for a class written in Java language with the corresponding report

> âš  Code coverage measurement is supported only for C language now.

UTBot Cloud consists of two parts:
* UTBot Site - client side (source code is stored in the current repository)
* [UTBot Online](https://github.com/UnitTestBot/UnitTestBot-Cloud) - server side

UTBot Cloud for generating tests, getting information about the launch tests, generating information about the number of lines of code covered by tests in C uses the UTBot C/C++ CLI console application. The application creates an abstraction to work with the [UTBot C/C++](https://github.com/UnitTestBot/UTBotCpp) tool generating tests.

UTBot Cloud for generating tests, getting information about the launch tests in Java uses the UTBot Java CLI console application. The application creates an abstraction to work with the [UTBot Java](https://github.com/UnitTestBot/UTBotJava) tool generating tests.
