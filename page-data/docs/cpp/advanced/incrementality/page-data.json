To control\nartifacts state and reuse them, UTBot generates UTBot Makefiles for every test generation and run step. Generated\nMakefiles are used for multiple purposes that are determined by environment variables, namely: compile sources, link\nthem into LLVM IR for KLEE, compile tests and link them into real library or executable for run, turn stubs off/on, turn\ncoverage off/on. When a request is made, corresponding rule from a Makefile is called. Hence, if rule dependencies are\nup to date, they are reused â€” Makefile watches artifacts creation timestamps and is able to determine if a Makefile\ntarget is up to date.</p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/docs/cpp/advanced/incrementality"}}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":["1550867996","2819311301"]}
