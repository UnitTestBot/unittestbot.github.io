# UTBot Use Cases

UTBot Server is able to work with sources on the same filesystem. You have two options to comfortably operate with those sources as well:
* You can use VS Code with UTBot extension locally and synchronize files with files on UTBot server host. For that, we recommend using VS Code [SFTP plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=liximomo.sftp). 
* You can Use VS Code [Remote-SSH](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh) feature to use VS Code with UTBot extension on the same host that runs UTBot server.
* You can operate UTBot Server via its [Command Line Interface](/docs/cpp/usage/cli).

## Using VS Code extension

Let's suppose you opened your sources folder with VS Code with UTBot extension. It does not matter if that happened on the same host with UTBot Server or on another one.
In any case, you will see [UTBot Wizard](/docs/cpp/usage/wizard) which will help you to set up your project for UTBot.

Firstly, it will ask for an IP and port to look for the UTBot Server. You can specify `localhost` if it is the same machine or an IP of the machine that runs UTBot Server.

Then, UTBot Wizard will ask for a path to look for sources, and you should specify a path on the host that runs UTBot Server. If you are on the same machine, then use your path, else use the path of the folder which you sync to.

After that, you should specify build folder of your project which contains build artifacts that UTBot uses to generate and build test files. If the project is not build yet, you can try to configure it automatically by clicking notifications that UTBot will send.

After you complete the UTBot Wizard, you should be ready to experience UTBot capabilities!

## Using Command Line Interface
This case is much simpler: you can stop the UTBot Server and invoke it as specified in in [CLI overview](/docs/cpp/usage/cli). You do need to install VS Code extension, as all the work happens in command line.
