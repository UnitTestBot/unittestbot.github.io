# Run Generated Tests

## Coverage and Test Results

UnitTestBot provides an opportunity to run generated tests right from VS Code.

Every generated test has a special CodeLens `Run Test With Coverage` above it. It allows you to run the specified test.

Also, in every test file generated by UTBot there is a CodeLens `Run Tests With Coverage` that makes it possible to run
all tests in the file. This Lens is located right above the line with `namespace UTBot`.

You can also run all tests that UnitTestBot has generated by calling the command `Run All Tests and Show Coverage`.

After you run tests, UTBot will display the coverage for the code fragments this test covers on the VS Code gutter.
Besides, UTBot can display results on the VS Code gutter near the test headers.

> ⚠️**Be advised**
>
> If you use a separate Tests Runner for VS Code, **it's recommended to disable** test status that UTBot displays after test runs.
> Otherwise, it might cause collision.

Below we provide examples of how you can run single test or the whole test file.
